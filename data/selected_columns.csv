"Factors Influencing Social Functioning of People With Schizophrenia, The study will last 36 months. The questionnaire for the assessment of physical health and medical conditions risk factors, as well as the manual concerning the procedures for screening and assessment of medical comorbidity, will be developed during the first three months of the study. The recruitment and assessment of all subjects will be completed within the first semester of the third year.||The analysis of data collected will be completed in the second semester of the third year.||PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS In all subjects a blood sample of 20 ml will be withdrawn from a peripheral vein for genetic analyses.||Evaluation of aspects related to the disease. For all patients a clinical form will be filled in with data on age and type of disease onset, course of the disease and treatments. All available sources of information (patient, family, medical records and mental health workers) will be used to complete the form.||The Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS) will be used to assess premorbid adjustment. It evaluates the achieved level of functioning before the onset of schizophrenia in four areas (social accessibility/isolation, peer relationships, ability to function outside the nuclear family, and capacity to form intimate social - sexual ties) during 4 periods of subject's life (childhood; early adolescence; late adolescence; adulthood), as well as the highest achieved global level of functioning. It comprises 26 items with a score ranging from 0 (healthiest end of the adjustment range) to 6 (indicating the least healthy end).||General psychopathology and positive symptoms will be evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).||Negative symptoms will be assessed using the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS). This scale includes 13 items and assesses 5 domains of negative symptoms: anhedonia, asociality, avolition, blunted affect and alogia, as well as a control item, not included in the negative domains, ""Distress"". For all items of the 5 domains higher scores are associated with greater impairment/presence of symptoms, while for the item Distress the highest score is associated with reduction or absence of negative emotions.||Depressive symptoms will be investigated using the Calgary Depression Rating Scale (CDRS), a rating scale designed to assess the level of depression in people with schizophrenia. It includes 9 items (depression; hopelessness; self depreciation; guilty ideas of reference; pathological guilt; morning depression; early wakening; suicide; observed depression) with a score ranging from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe).||The possible presence of extrapyramidal symptoms, whose assessment is required to exclude that the observed negative symptoms are secondary to them, will be verified by means of the St. Hans Rating Scale (SHRS), a multidimensional rating scale comprising four subscales: hyperkinesias, parkinsonism, akathisia and dystonia. Each subscale includes one or more items with a score ranging from 0 (absent) to 6 (severe).||Neurocognitive functions will be evaluated by means of the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). The battery includes tests for the assessment of seven distinct cognitive domains: a) processing speed, b) attention/vigilance, c) working memory, d) verbal learning, e) visual learning, f) social cognition and g) reasoning and problem solving.||The assessment of social cognition, partly included in the MCCB, will be completed using the Facial Emotion Identification Test and a theory of mind test The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT). In the Facial Emotion Identification Test (FEIT), 55 faces are presented on a screen; the subject has to choose the facial emotion expressed by each face among 7 possibilities (anger, disgust, neutral, happiness, surprise, fear, sadness). The TASIT includes three sections: 1) Emotion Evaluation Test, that examines the ability to recognize basic emotions shown by other people, in which 28 vignettes are presented to the subject who has to choose the emotion expressed by a target actor from a multiple-choice array (surprise, happiness, anger, sadness, anxiety, disgust, neutral); 2) Test of Social Inference (Minimal), that evaluates the ability to perceive social inferences, specifically those involving the use of sarcasm; 15 vignettes are presented and the subject has to answer, for each vignette, four questions regarding, respectively, what one of the actors was ""doing"", what was he/she trying to ""say"", what was he/she ""thinking"" and what was he/she ""feeling""; 3) Test of Social Inference (Enriched), that evaluates the ability to perceive social inferences involving lying and using sarcasm; 16 vignettes are presented and the same questions of the second section are asked.||Assessment of personal resources The evaluation of physical health status will be carried out through the application of a standardized protocol developed by the unit N. 5 of Naples.||The assessment of coping style will be made by means of the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced inventory - Brief, including 28 items, divided into 14 scales: positive reframing, self-distraction, expression, use of instrumental support, active coping, denial, religion, humor, behavioral disengagement, use of emotional support, substance use, acceptance, planning, self-blame. The tool aims to capture a wide range of coping strategies in real life situations.||The evaluation of self-esteem will be carried out using the Self-Esteem Rating Scale (SERS), which assesses different aspects of the self-esteem, such as feeling socially and self-competent, being worth of respect, feeling intelligent and able to solve problems. SERS is composed of 40 items, with ratings on a 7-point Likert scale.||The recovery style will be evaluated using the Recovery Style Questionnaire. This self-administered instrument consists of 39 items that refer to the construct of continuity, ownership, responsibility, curiosity, education, help-seeking, blame, cause, optimism, impact, fear, liking and satisfaction. For each of them the person is categorized as sealer or integrator.||Resilience will be evaluated through the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA). The RSA is a scale that provides a multidimensional assessment of resilience general characteristics. It includes 33 items that examine intra-and inter-personal protective factors thought to facilitate adaptation when facing psychosocial adversity. Factor analysis showed six factors: a) personal competence, b) positive perception of the future, c) social competence, d), personal structure, and) family cohesion, f) social resources.||The relationship with mental health services will be evaluated with the Service Engagement Scale (SES), which includes 16 items grouped into 4 subscales: a) availability, b) cooperation c) help seeking d) adherence to treatment. The person is given a score on a 4-point Likert scale. c) Evaluation of factors related to the context. For the evaluation of subject's family social - economic status the Social Economic Status will be used. The SES is based on: a) education and b) type of work. The educational level is measured on a 7-level scale (1=elementary school, 7=post-degree/specialization courses) and the type of work is rated on a 9-level scale (1=laborer, 9=high level managerial positions). To calculate the index the education level and the type of work of each parent is weighted.||The amount of social policies expenditure and the unemployment rate in the geographical macro-area (Northeast, Northwest, Central, South and Islands) will be taken from the latest Italian National Institute of Statistic (ISTAT) tables. The availability of a disability pension, and access to family and social incentives will be investigated through a social - demographic questionnaire developed ad hoc with which data on sex, age, marital status, schooling, housing, and luxuries habits will be also collected. For the evaluation of the social network the Social Network Questionnaire (SNQ) will be used. It is a self-administered questionnaire that evaluates the structural and qualitative aspects of the social network. It includes 15 items, grouped into 4 factors: a) quality and frequency of social contacts; b) practical social support; c) emotional support, d) quality of an intimate relationship. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 ""never"" to 4 ""always"". The evaluation of the stigma associated with mental illness will be carried out using two instruments: the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI), which will be administered to all patients and evaluates the experience of stigma and internalized self-rejection, and the Perceived Devaluation and Discrimination Scale (PDD), which measures the perceived stigma, i.e., the attitudes of the general population with respect to mental disorders, which will be administered to all subjects. The ISMI is a scale that includes 29 items and 5 subscales for self-assessment of subjective experience of stigma. Each item is rated on a 4-level Likert scale, where higher scores indicate greater levels of internalized stigma. The PDD includes 12 items, each of whom is rated on a 5-level Likert scale, with higher scores indicating greater stigma.||d) Assessment of functional capacity and real-life functioning The functional capacity will be evaluated using the short version of the Performance-based Skills Assessment, University of California, San Diego (UCSD) , a performance-based instrument that investigates two areas: Financial Skills (counting money, counting change and paying bills) and Communication Skills (to dial a telephone number for emergency, for information, dial a telephone number from memory; to reschedule an appointment by telephone; to understand and to remember the instructions on a Medical Doctor Appointment Letter). Individual real-life functioning will be assessed by the Specific Level of Function Scale (SLOF), a hybrid instrument that explores many aspects of functioning and is based on judgments by a caregiver/operator (or the direct observation) of behavior and functioning of patients. It consists of 43 items and includes the following domains: a) physical efficiency; b) skills in self-care; c) interpersonal relationships; d) social acceptability; e) community activities (e.g., shopping, using public transportation); f) working abilities. The scale that assesses ""Personal and Social Functioning"" (PSF) will be also used; it evaluates the areas of self-care, socially useful activities, personal and social relationships and disturbing and aggressive behaviors.||GENETIC ASSOCIATION ANALYSES WITH THE PHENOTYPES OF INTEREST The Naples research unit n. 6 will perform an association study between selected putative schizophrenia genes and specific psychometric, neurophysiological and neurocognitive schizophrenia endophenotypes; moreover, the research unit will search for de novo copy-number variations (CNV) as putative risk factors for schizophrenia or schizophrenia endophenotypes and for de novo protein-altering mutations that may contribute to the genetic component of schizophrenia endophenotypes.||STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF DATA To identify the factors that affect most real-life functioning of people diagnosed with schizophrenia multiple regression statistical models will be used. Real-life functioning and functional capacity indices will be defined as dependent variables. The three blocks of variables, i.e. disease-related variable, personal resources and context-related variables, will be the independent variables or predictors. structural equation model (SEM), that according to some authors is robust against the problem of multicollinearity occurring in a regression model when there is a linear correlation among the independent variables, will be used. This analysis allows to draw assumptions on the causality between the variables and, based on path analysis o identify potential factors mediating and moderating the relationships between dependent and independent variables. The explored models will be subsequently tested with confirmatory analyses.||Estimated sample size for this analysis is of at least 5 independent observations for each index in the model. Therefore, by including in the model: 3 demographic indices (age, sex and education), 15 variables related to the disease (PANSS-general and PANSS-positive subscale scores, 2 negative symptom domains derived from BNSS, 6 cognitive domains from the MCCB, 4 indices of social cognition, derived from the specific section of the MCCB, TASIT and FEIT, the total score for depression on the Calgary scale), 36 indices related to the personal resources (6 factors of Resilience, 14 Coping factors, 13 Recovery styles factors, 1 score for Self-Esteem, 1 index of relationship with mental health services, 1 physical health index) and 10 related to the context (1 index of economic status, 5 indices of financial opportunities and work/family and social incentives, 2 stigma indices, 2 social network factors), for a total of 64 indices, it is estimated that an appropriate sample of patients will be 64x5=320 subjects.||The effects of dichotomous variables (eg, gender) and ordinal (eg, social class) will be assessed with one- or multiple-way analyses of variance. The analyses will be conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS)., Schizophrenia|Real-Life Functioning|Schizophrenia Endophenotypes",2

"Perception of Facial Emotions in Schizophrenia and 22q11 Deletion Syndrome, Methods:||This study will be conducted using visual steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). Visual SSVEPs are periodic neural electrophysiological activities that arise in response to fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS). They will be recorded in response to the periodic presentation of faces, according to an oddball paradigm. While pictures of faces will appear at a 6 Hz rate, only 1 out of 5 will display an emotion, corresponding to a 1.2 Hz oddball frequency. Different emotions will be tested (happiness, sadness, anger, fear and disgust), displayed with different intensities (20%, 60%, 100%). SSVEPs at 6 Hz will reflect general visual mechanisms (in response to a mixture of low-level (i.e., contrast coding) and high-level (i.e., face detection) processes). Importantly, SSVEPs at 1.2 Hz will index the visual mechanisms specifically involved in facial expression perception and their sensitivity to emotion intensity. Both measures will help determine the underlying brain topographies.||Alongside, clinical and neuropsychological tests will be conducted. While the clinical tests will evaluate the severity of the symptoms, the neuropsychological tests will assess different features such as attention, memory, verbal and visuo-spatial abilities. The patients' scores will be linked with their cerebral activity in response to facial expressions.||Outcomes:||To better understand the impairment of facial emotion recognition in schizophrenia and 22q11.2DS and to improve its care., schizophrenia|Facial emotions",2
"Evaluation of Stroop Effect in Patients With Schizophrenia, First, participants will receive six categories of stimuli presented in a classical way: (1) incongruous stimulus classical (BLUE written in green for example); (2) associated incongruous stimuli (SKY written in green for example); (3) conventional congruent stimuli (BLUE written in blue for example); (4) associated congruent stimuli (SKY written in blue for example); (5) neutral words (BRIDGE written in green for example); And (6) neutral stimulus (XXXX written in green for example).||In a second step (after a 5 minute break), they will receive these six categories of stimuli, but only half will be presented in a classic way and the other half will be presented in order to attract attention as in Augustinova and Ferrand 2007). To do this, in (1) incongruous stimuli classical like BLUE, a single letter (like B for example) will be colored in green for example and the rest of the word (LUE) will appear in gray); In (2) incongruous stimuli associated as SKY, only K for example will be green and the rest of the word will appear in gray); In (3) conventional congruent stimuli such as BLUE, only B for example will be written in blue and the rest of the word will appear in gray); In (4) associated congruent stimuli such as SKY only K for example will be written in blue and the rest of the word will appear in gray); In (5) neutral words like BRIDGE, only D will be colored in green for example and the rest of the word will appear in gray; And finally, in (6) neutral stimuli like XXXX, only one X will be colored in green for example and the rest of the X will appear in gray.||The task will be to name the color of each word (by stating the color verbally) as quickly and correctly as possible, while ignoring the written word. In this experiment, we will measure the time taken to denominate the color (in milliseconds) as well as the percentages of incorrect answers.||The first step allows to determine the stroop effect and the second the semantic conflict., Schizophrenia|Stroop effect|Semantic conflict|Response conflict",2
"The Effects of Nicotine on Cognition in Schizophrenia, We propose to test the efficacy and safety of transdermal nicotine for attention and working memory in outpatients with stable symptoms of schizophrenia treated with high potency antipsychotic medications that do not smoke cigarettes or use nicotine-containing products. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to determine whether transdermal nicotine, initiated in a clinic setting and dosed for four hours is safe and effective for improving attention and spatial working memory deficits in patients with schizophrenia. This is an add-on study, subjects will continue with their usual medications and treatments throughout.||Subjects are 30- non-smoking outpatients with stable treated schizophrenia and 30 normal controls who do not have a major mental illness and who are matched for age sex and parental education. Subjects are randomized to one of 2 groups for order of receiving active and placebo patch, using a computer generated random number sequence. Randomization is concealed using opaque envelopes. Assessors and subjects are blind to group allocation.||The primary outcome measure is d' measure on the CPT-IP following a 4 hour administration of the transdermal nicotine patch. Secondary outcome measures are performance on tasks assessing attention, numeric and visuospatial working memory, psychomotor ability, executive functioning and motivation for reward following nicotine patch administration.||Specific Aims||To evaluate the effectiveness of transdermal nicotine compared with placebo for attentional impairment in patients with schizophrenia||Hypothesis 1.1: Subjects will demonstrate greater signal detection as measured by the d' (hits vs. false alarms) on the Continuous Performance Test Identical Pairs Version (CPT-IP) following 4-hour nicotine administration when compared with placebo administration.||Hypothesis 1.2: Subjects will demonstrate decreased false alarms on the CPT-IP following 4-hour nicotine administration when compared with placebo administration.||Hypothesis 1.3: Subjects will demonstrate decreased reaction time on the CPT-IP following 4- hour nicotine administration when compared with placebo administration.||To evaluate the effect of transdermal nicotine in patients with schizophrenia compared with normal matched controls||Hypothesis 2.1: Schizophrenia subjects will demonstrate greater improvement in signal detection as measured by the d' (hits vs. false alarms) on the Continuous Performance test identical pairs version(CPT-IP) following 4-hour nicotine administration when compared with normal controls.||Hypothesis 2.2: Schizophrenia subjects will demonstrate greater reduction in false alarms on the CPT-IP following 4-hour nicotine administration when compared with normal controls.||Hypothesis 2.3: Schizophrenia subjects will demonstrate decreased reaction time on the CPT-IP following 4- hour nicotine administration when compared with normal controls.

"Culturally Based Family Therapy for Improving Treatment Outcome for People With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a disabling mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide. People with schizophrenia frequently experience hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking, movement disorders, emotional numbness, social withdrawal, and cognitive deficits. These symptoms can hinder a person's ability to perform everyday functions, such as hold a job and maintain normal social relationships. When combined with medication, family-oriented therapy interventions have been beneficial for people with schizophrenia. There are few programs, however, that are tailored to the needs of minorities. With the rising number of minority populations in the U.S., it is important to develop psychotherapy interventions that are designed specifically for these groups. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally based family therapy intervention in improving treatment outcome in people with schizophrenia.||Participants in this 12-month, open label study will first attend a 2-hour screening visit, at which information will be gathered regarding coping styles, spirituality, and expressed emotion. Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either culturally based therapy or treatment as usual. Although the culturally based therapy will be tailored to the needs and values of Hispanics, people who are not Hispanic will not be excluded. The culturally based therapy will entail 15 weekly therapy sessions, which will focus on family unity, psychoeducation, spirituality, communication skills, and problem-solving. The group receiving treatment as usual will attend 3 weekly psychoeducation sessions that will focus on informing participants about schizophrenia. Outcomes for both groups will be assessed upon completion of treatment and at follow-up visits at Months 6 and 12., Culture|Family|Therapy",2

"Diagnostic Announcement to Relatives of Patients With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects 1% of the population worldwide. The diagnostic announcement of this chronic disorder is an essential step in the patient's care. Recommendations specify the importance of including caregivers at the time of the announcement. In practice, caregivers are not systematically associated with the announcement of the diagnosis of schizophrenia, while the daily support of patients is provided in 75% of cases by the family. This support can lead to the exhaustion of caregivers and have repercussions on their sick loved one.||This study will qualitatively describe and explore the experience of the diagnostic announcement in relatives of patients with schizophrenia. Specifically, the investigators will explore the history before the diagnosis is announced, the conditions of the announcement and the experiences of relatives as well as the impact at the personal and family-levels. This study will also explore the expectations of caregivers and avenues for reflection for announcement of schizophrenia diagnosis.||The number of subjects to be included in this study is therefore set at 30. A preselection of each potential participant will be carried out by phone or in person to ensure the presence of inclusion criteria and the absence of non-inclusion criteria. The patients will also be provided with oral information about the study to allow sufficient time to reflect before inclusion. Then, the selection-inclusion-interview visit will take place visually in an intra-hospital or extra-hospital consultation structure of the Center Hospitalier Alpes-Isère. This visit will be unique and will consist of the entire protocol. It will be both a selection, inclusion and interview visit.||Once the results have been analyzed, this study will provide a better understanding of the experiences of relatives of patients when the diagnosis of schizophrenia is announced, the impact of this announcement on caregivers and family relationships and the expectations of caregivers regarding this announcement. In the long term, the data collected will be add value in developing medical recommendations on consultation to announce the diagnosis of schizophrenia to relatives of patients, in order to best meet the expectations of relatives and to minimize as much as possible the harmful impact that can have such announcement., 0",2

"The Effects of Aripiprazole on the Processing of Rewards in Schizophrenia, TITLE: Aripiprazole effects on reward processing in deficit syndrome schizophrenia Principal Investigator: Erica Duncan, M.D.||Background- This is a study of the way people with schizophrenia may feel when they get rewards. Certain parts of the brain play a part in people feeling happy when they win some sort of reward or have a good thing happen to them. Some people with schizophrenia may have trouble feeling pleasure because part of their brains, the frontal cortex, may not work properly. We are doing this study to understand how the frontal cortex works in people with and without schizophrenia when they are trying to win a reward. We will use a special kind of brain scan called Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to show the brain working in action. fMRI scanning uses a big magnet to take special pictures of the brain.||A new medicine called aripiprazole has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating symptoms of schizophrenia. This medicine has a new mechanism of action that helps neural functioning in the part of the brain that is involved with planning and goal setting. We think this new medication may help with brain processing of rewards. We are therefore studying the brain with fMRI scans before and during treatment with this aripiprazole.||Objective- The objective of this study is to determine whether subjects with negative symptoms of schizophrenia have abnormal functioning of brain circuits relevant to reward processing, and to determine whether any such abnormalities are normalized by treatment with aripiprazole.||Research Plan-Aim 1. Define impairments in the neural correlates of reward processing in primary deficit syndrome schizophrenics compared to normal controls.||Ten stable outpatients with primary deficit syndrome schizophrenia will be compared to ten normal controls in a BOLD contrast fMRI experiment constructed to assess in a parametric design the recruitment of reward circuitry in response to increasing monetary reward. We predict that frontal cortical areas important in reward processing such as the OFC and ACC will have reduced activation in the schizophrenic subjects.||Aim 2. Assess the ability of aripiprazole to normalize reward circuit functioning in deficit syndrome schizophrenia, and correlate fMRI changes with clinical changes in negative symptoms.||The ten schizophrenic subjects in Aim 1 will be switched from standard antipsychotic treatment to twelve weeks of open label aripiprazole and retested with the fMRI monetary reward task. We predict that twelve weeks of aripiprazole treatment will normalize the activation of OFC and ACC in response to monetary reward stimuli. We further predict that the degree of normalization in fMRI activation will correlate with negative symptom improvement on aripiprazole.||Methods- Up to 25 volunteers with schizophrenia and 25 volunteers without a psychiatric disorder will participate in this study at the Atlanta VA Medical Center. Subjects will first be interviewed about their medical and psychiatric history, and any current symptoms they are having. They will receive an fMRI scan during which they will play a computer game that rewards correct responses with money. This fMRI session will allow for the assessment of which parts of the brain are functioning during rewarding conditions. The results will be compared for subjects with and without schizophrenia.||The subjects with schizophrenia will have their antipsychotic medication tapered and switched to aripiprazole during a twelve week treatment phase. They will be seen at the end of Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 10, and Week 12. At the last visit the fMRI scan will be repeated during the same reward task.||Clinical Relevance- The inability to experience pleasure and the inability to pursue goals is an important symptom of schizophrenia. These symptoms probably play a huge role in preventing many people with schizophrenia from leading full and fulfilling lives. A central defect in reward processing pathways in the brain may account for these symptoms. If aripiprazole can be demonstrated to improve functioning in these brain pathways, this would greatly advance our understanding of schizophrenia and could bring greater functioning to patients with schizophrenia.||Complete study Protocol:||ARIPIPRAZOLE EFFECTS ON REWARD PROCESSING IN DEFICIT SYNDROME SCHIZOPHRENIA||Principal Investigator: Erica Duncan, MD||Specific Aims||The chronic negative symptoms of schizophrenia remain poorly responsive to psychopharmacologic treatment. The impaired motivation of primary deficit syndrome patients prevents them from pursuing social and occupational goals and prevents them from developing meaningful and productive lives. This proposal is based on the test of a hypothesis that schizophrenic patients with enduring deficit symptoms suffer from impairments in reward processing and the translation of perceived reward salience into goal-oriented behavior. Preclinical and clinical research has revealed the functioning of a distributed neural network in the processing of reward stimuli. Regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) such as orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are key frontal cortical elements of a neural circuit that mediates reward salience, reward expectation, and reward approach behavior. Aripiprazole, in virtue of its' activity as a dopamine (DA) partial agonist, is uniquely suited to enhance functioning of these frontal areas crucial to reward processing. We hypothesize that primary deficit syndrome schizophrenia is associated with functional deficits in reward circuitry detectable by fMRI scanning during a monetary reward task. We further hypothesize that treatment with aripiprazole will normalize reward circuit function in these subjects and thus contribute to improvements in negative symptoms. The following specific aims will test these hypotheses:||Aim 1. Define impairments in the neural correlates of reward processing in primary deficit syndrome schizophrenics compared to normal controls.||Ten stable outpatients with primary deficit syndrome schizophrenia will be compared to ten normal controls in a BOLD contrast fMRI experiment constructed to assess in a parametric design the recruitment of reward circuitry in response to increasing monetary reward. We predict that frontal cortical areas important in reward processing such as the OFC and ACC will have reduced activation in the schizophrenic subjects.||Aim 2. Assess the ability of aripiprazole to normalize reward circuit functioning in deficit syndrome schizophrenia, and correlate fMRI changes with clinical changes in negative symptoms.||The ten schizophrenic subjects in Aim 1 will be switched from standard antipsychotic treatment to twelve weeks of open label aripiprazole and retested with the fMRI monetary reward task. We predict that twelve weeks of aripiprazole treatment will normalize the activation of OFC and ACC in response to monetary reward stimuli. We further predict that the degree of normalization in fMRI activation will correlate with negative symptom improvement on aripiprazole.||Background and Significance||Negative Symptoms as a Deficit in Reward Processing Antipsychotic medications are often able to relieve the positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganization. However the response of deficit symptoms to psychopharmacology remains disappointing. Many patients with minimal active psychotic symptoms are severely impaired in their functioning because of enduring deficit syndrome features.||A key component of the deficit syndrome is a lack of motivation to pursue goals in educational, occupational, social, and recreational domains. This proposal rests on the hypothesis that a core feature of the amotivational component of the deficit state is a deficiency in reward processing. This deficiency in turn fails to provide sufficient stimulation of conditioning reinforcement of approach behavior serving the pursuit of rewards. In most patients the impairment is not so severe that the patients fail to pursue the primary rewards of food and drink. But motivation to pursue more complex secondary reinforcers such as economic success, stable loving relationships, avocations, intellectual fulfillment and other uniquely human goals are strikingly lacking in deficit syndrome patients.||Frontal Cortical Hypofunction in Negative Symptoms Refinements in the DA hypothesis have emphasized an imbalance between mesocortical and subcortical/mesolimbic DA activity. Hyperactivity of the mesolimbic DA system has been implicated in the positive symptoms of the illness; hypofunctioning of the mesocortical DA pathway has been implicated in the pathophysiology of negative symptoms (Weinberger 1987; Davis et al.1991). The finding of neurophysiologic hypofunction of the frontal cortex during cognitive activation studies in schizophrenic subjects has given rise to the concept of hypofrontality (Weinberger et al. 1986; Berman et al. 1986; for review see Weinberger et al. 1994). Furthermore, frontal hypofunction has been linked specifically to negative symptoms irrespective of the severity of positive symptoms in unmedicated schizophrenics (Wolkin et al. 1992).||Neural Circuitry of Reward Processing Research into the neural correlates of reward processing indicates the importance of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons and distributed reward circuits to the coding of reward anticipation and salience, and the translation of motivation into approach behavior. Key structures that have been implicated in reward processing on the basis of animal studies include DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra and their target areas such as the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), amygdala, and OFC (Wise 1980; Wise and Hoffman 1992; Koob 1992; Robbins and Everitt 1996; see Schultz 2000, 2001 for review). Circuitry linking these areas is hypothesized to mediate several aspects of reward processing such as the detection of primary or secondary reward stimuli, prediction of expected future rewards, and the use of information to control goal-directed or motivated behavior (Schultz 2000). Recently developed methods are being used to study the reward pathways in normal humans and subjects with substance abuse disorders in the fMRI environment. These studies implicate the mesocorticolimbic DA system and functionally connected areas: OFC, ACC, dorsolateral PFC, amygdala, NAcc, and insula (Grant et al. 1996; Childress et al. 1999; Maas et al. 1998; Garavan et al. 2000; Kilts et al. 2001; Wexler et al. 2001). fMRI paradigms using money as a secondary reinforcer reveal activations in many of these same areas: amygdala, NAcc, ventral striatum, and areas of PFC (Thut et al. 1997; Elliott et al. 2000; Elliott et al. 2003). The fact that very similar areas are activated by primary reinforcer paradigms in animal studies, drug cue studies in substance abusers, and monetary reward paradigms in normal controls suggests that the study of monetary reward processing is a valid strategy to assess the integrity of reward circuitry in experimental paradigms.||Overlap of Reward Circuitry and Areas Implicated in Negative Symptoms As indicated above, dopaminergic hypofunction in the PFC is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of negative symptoms. The presentation of reward or stimuli that predict reward stimulates the phasic activation of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain (Shultz 2000) that innervate the PFC. Hence there is a critical overlap of circuitry implicated in negative symptoms and circuitry that subserves reward processing. This overlap supports the use of reward paradigms to explore the functional integrity of mesocortical DA inputs and PFC function.||Aripiprazole and Negative Symptoms The novel antipsychotic, aripiprazole, has a unique pharmacological mechanism of action that makes it potentially unique for the amelioration of negative symptoms. Aripiprazole is thought to increase DA activity in the PFC by virtue of its' activity as a partial agonist at post-synaptic DA2 receptors (Burris et al. 2002). We hypothesize that treatment with aripiprazole will normalize the function of PFC reward circuitry through increased DA functioning in frontal cortical regions (OFC, ACC) that subserve reward processing.||Potential Importance of Proposal for Treatment Indications of Aripiprazole The severe impairment of motivated behavior in patients with deficit syndrome schizophrenia is strongly suggestive of an abnormality in the neural circuits that mediate reward processing and the translation of reward salience to motivated behavior. To date there are no published fMRI studies of the functioning of reward circuits in subjects with deficit syndrome schizophrenia. We hypothesize that negative symptom schizophrenics will exhibit impaired fMRI estimated activation of reward circuitry compared to normal controls, and that aripiprazole treatment will normalize functioning of this circuitry.||The demonstration of improvements in negative symptoms in medication trials has been elusive. Even an agent capable of improving reward processing might not produce detectable decreases in rating scales designed to measure negative symptoms over the short term. This is because patients with chronic deficit states have compromised functioning due to the cumulative effects of social and occupational dysfunction. In patients such as these, the normalization of reward processing circuits by a medication such as aripiprazole would only be the first step. These patients are likely to require considerable psychosocial rehabilitation to recoup occupational and social functioning and achieve meaningful gains in negative symptom rating scales. However, normalization of reward circuitry function would strongly suggest that aripiprazole has potential to improve chronic negative symptoms when combined with a supporting rehabilitative program. Significant changes in reward circuit function would also strongly support the early intervention potential for aripiprazole to prevent chronic deterioration in function if first break patients were treated with this agent early in their course.||Materials and Methods||Subjects Ten male schizophrenic subjects ages 18-60 will be recruited. Diagnosis will be confirmed by structured diagnostic interview (SCID-I). Primary deficit syndrome will be confirmed by rating with the Schedule for the Deficit Syndrome (SDS), a scale that defines schizophrenic subjects according to whether they have chronic negative symptoms even across periods when positive symptoms are in remission (Kirkpatrick et al. 1989). This scale thus allows for the differentiation of those patients who have negative symptoms consistently across clinical states from those whose negative symptoms emerge when they are acutely psychotic and remit when positive symptoms remit. Additionally, subjects must have a minimum score of 30 on the SANS. Subjects will be excluded for clinically significant unstable medical illness, history of neurological disease including head trauma with loss of consciousness >5 minutes, active substance abuse or dependence within the prior three months, any contraindication to fMRI, left handedness, mental retardation, color blindness, antipsychotic treatment resistance, or known allergy to or nonresponse to aripiprazole. Subjects with schizophrenia will be excluded if they do not have a working telephone.||Ten male normal comparison subjects will recruited, matched in mean age and ethnicity to the schizophrenic group. Absence of psychopathology will be confirmed by SCID-I, NP version. Subjects will be excluded for clinically significant unstable medical illness, history of neurological disease including head trauma with loss of consciousness >5 minutes, active substance abuse or dependence within the prior three months, any contraindication to fMRI, left handedness, color blindness, or mental retardation. Normal controls will be matched to schizophrenic subjects with regard to monthly income so that monetary rewards during the task will have comparable reinforcement value.||Baseline Assessment Prior to fMRI scanning all subjects will be assessed for smoking status by means of the Fagerstrom Smoking Tolerance Questionnaire (Fagerstrom 1978) and nicotine dependent subjects will be instructed to smoke their usual amount prior to reporting for scanning. Screening for intact vision (≥ 20/25 uncorrected or corrected with eyeglasses or contact lenses) by means an eye chart will be conducted. Cognitive status will be assessed in the following domains: attention (Continuous Performance Test), psychomotor reaction time (finger tapping test), memory (California Verbal Learning Test), IQ (Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, vocabulary and matrices subtests), and executive function (Stroop Task). The schizophrenic subjects will be rated for severity of psychopathology by means of the PANSS, Abrams and Taylor Rating Scale for Emotional Blunting (A&T), SANS, Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), and the Quality of Life Scale. Current side effects to antipsychotics will be assessed by means of the Barnes Akathisia Scale and the Simpson Angus Scale. Schizophrenic subjects will have 30cc of blood drawn for CBC and SMA-12 to ensure stable baseline medical status prior to switching to aripiprazole.||Cognitive Task Meaningful comparisons of schizophrenic and non-schizophrenic subjects by a cognitive task necessitates the use of a simple task to minimize confounds related to group differences in cognitive ability. A parametric manipulation of reward contingency will control for group differences in task performance. The proposed monetary incentive task, adapted from that of Elliott et al. (2003), is chosen because of its simplicity and parametric design. The subjects will be given a simple target detection task in which they will be instructed to squeeze a response bulb when they see a red or blue square. Different colored squares will be presented on a screen for 1.3 sec each. When they correctly signal the target stimuli they will see a reward stimulus informing them of how much money they have won on that trial. For trials with non-targets (paying no reward if the subject squeezes the bulb) the subjects will see a neutral text telling them to wait. The reward amounts will vary from 5¢ to $1 per trial (5¢, 25¢, 50¢, 75¢, or $1). The task will be divided into five blocks separated by 30 sec rest periods. Each block will contain 40 trials. Trial types will be presented in randomized order within each block: 30% of trials will contain one of the two target stimuli. Each block will pay correct responses at one of the five monetary reward levels. The task is designed specifically to allow for both an ""on-off"" assessment of activations in the presence or absence of reward, but also for a parametric analysis of brain areas that increase their activation with increased reward levels. The subjects will be told that their payment for participation in the fMRI scan will be the total money they accumulate by correct responses during the task. This latter point is important in that the money won during task performance has a real world salience more likely to enhance reward-related activations than if all subjects automatically were paid the same amount regardless of their accuracy. Thus the subjects receive actual rather than simulated reward.||fMRI Scanning Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI scanning will be performed on a research dedicated Siemens 3T whole body MRI scanner located in the Emory Hospital MRI Center. Foam padding will be used to restrict the subjects' head motion within the magnet. 30 axial slices of 3 mm thickness will be acquired parallel to the AC-PC line with a matrix size of 64 x 64 over a field of view of 22 x 22 cm, using a TE of 30 msec. With this protocol we have successfully imaged the orbitofrontal cortex with minimal magnetic susceptibility artifacts. The functional images will be obtained using a T2* weighted spiral-scan pulse sequence (TR 3000 msec, TE 25 msec, flip angle 60 deg). High resolution anatomical T1-weighted MR images will be acquired for localization of task-related neural activations (TR =10 msec, TE = 4.5 msec, TI=900 msec, FOV=24 cm, 256 x 256 matrix, contiguous 3 mm slices covering the whole brain).||Aripiprazole Treatment After receiving the first scan, the schizophrenic subjects will be started on open label aripiprazole 15 mg po qd. Over the subsequent six weeks they will be titrated to a target dose of 30 mg po qd and maintained on this dose for the next six weeks. The aripiprazole titration schedule will be as follows: 15 mg Weeks 1-2, 20 mg Weeks 3-6, and then 30 mg. During the first six weeks of the treatment phase their prior antipsychotic will be gradually tapered down (75% of total daily dose in Week 1 and 2, 50% of total daily dose in Weeks 3 and 4, 25% of total daily dose in Week 5 and 6) and then discontinued.||The subjects will be brought in for study visits at the end of Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, and Week 8, Week 10, and Week 12. At each study visit they will be rated with the PANSS, SANS, CGI, and A&T. Extrapyramidal side effects and akathisia will be rated with the Simpson Angus Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale respectively. The Quality of Life Scale, the CVLT, CPT, and Stroop Test will be repeated at the end of Week 12.||Stopping Rules for Subjects with Schizophrenia There is a risk of symptom exacerbation when antipsychotic medication is switched. For this reason, several safeguards will be put into place.||Subjects will be excluded if they have a history of suicidal, or assaultive behavior during psychotic decompensations.|The subjects will be given a cross-titration whereby their prior antipsychotic medication is gradually tapered over six weeks while aripiprazole is being titrated to maximum dose.|Subjects in the schizophrenia group will be closely monitored during the treatment phase. They will be given reminder calls the day before each study visit. If they do not come for a scheduled visit, the study staff will call and reschedule for the soonest day they can come in. Subjects without a working telephone will be excluded.|At each visit subjects will be rated with the CGI. If the CGI Global Improvement Scale is rated 6 (Much Worse) or 7 (Very Much Worse) at any visit, they will be dropped from the study and their previous antipsychotic will be resumed at the dose prior to enrollment.||fMRI Image Analysis Imaging data will be analyzed by means of MATLAB and statistical parametric mapping software (SPM99). The images will be resliced and corrected for motion by registration to the first functional image acquired for each subject using a 6 parameter transformation (Friston et al 1995). Images will be spatially normalized to a Montreal Neurological Institute template. A high-pass filter will be used to remove low frequency noise. Image smoothing using a 6 mm Gaussian kernel will be used to enhance signal-to-noise ratios and accommodate differences in neuroanatomy to facilitate group comparisons. The delayed cerebral blood flow response to activation conditions will be modeled using the standard hemodynamic response function. Statistical analysis will proceed using a random effects model to examine outcomes of the parametric design of the experiment (Buchel et al. 1998). We will model both linear and nonlinear hemodynamic responses in regions of interest: Nacc, amygdala, striatum, thalamus, OFC, ACC, and hippocampus.||Analysis of Behavioral Data For Aim 1, cognitive data will be analyzed with a between subjects MANOVA to compare neurocognitive results between schizophrenics and normal controls. For Aim 2, behavioral rating scale data and repeated cognitive test scores (for CVLT, Stroop Test, CPT) will be analyzed with a repeated measures MANOVA model using timepoint as a within subjects factor.||References||Berman KF, Zec RF, Weinberger DR (1986) Physiologic dysfunction of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia.

"The Effects of Varenicline on Cognitive Function in Patients With Schizophrenia, Cognitive deficits have been considered as a core symptom domain of schizophrenia. Amelioration of or improvement in cognitive impairments is becoming an important focus of clinical treatment development. Varenicline is a potent and selective alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist that has been developed for smoking cessation. In animal studies, alpha 4 beta 2 receptor agonists significantly improve working memory and attention function. Subjects will be assigned in 1:1 ratio to receive varenicline or placebo respectively. Assessments will be done using several neuropsychologic tests, clinical rating scale including assessment of nicotine withdrawal scales.Varenicline has been found to be efficacious for smoking cessation in the general population and animal studies have demonstrated the cognitive benefits of this agent. However, no published work is available evaluating the cognitive effects in humans. Thus, patients may experience improvements in cognitive function and in people who are smokers, these people may be able to achieve abstinence in smoking. This will in turn improve long-term functional outcomes and health outcomes in people with schizophrenia. This is an exciting opportunity for discovery if indeed cognitive abilities could be improved with this adjunctive treatment., Schizophrenia|Cognition|Varenicline",2

"L-arginine in Treatment as Usual in Schizophrenia, In the current study, our goals were to examine the clinical benefits of the nitric oxide (NO) donor and main precursor of NO, L-arginine, to further improve the symptoms of schizophrenia with minimum or no additional side-effects. L-Arginine is classified as a semi-essential or conditionally essential amino acid depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors have functional connections to the NO system in the brain. Dysfunction of connectivity of the neuroregulators glutamate and NO have been implicated in mechanisms of psychosis. Therefore, any downstream effects of NMDA dysfunction in schizophrenia may be ultimately mediated by the NO system at a cellular level. As an augmenting treatment to antipsychotic therapy, we examined the ability of L-arginine to further improve residual symptoms in the illness., 0",2
"Event-Related Potential (ERP) Biomarkers in Subjects With Schizophrenia and Healthy Volunteer Subjects, Among the most replicated pathophysiological findings in schizophrenia is the impairment of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) recorded during the auditory oddball procedure. In this procedure, time-locked electroencephalogram (EEG) responses are recorded during auditory processing of frequent and rare tones differing in pitch or duration. In addition, a smaller but substantial literature has reported deficits in the auditory steady-state EEG response (ASSR) to a 40 Hz train of auditory tones in subjects with schizophrenia versus healthy control subjects.||While measurement of ERPs in the drug development setting has shown promise, the instruments, infrastructure, and standardization of these methods has lagged. New, portable, easy-to-use, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved devices are now available for the automated collection and analysis of EEG and ERP data.||This observational, non-interventional, clinical study will recruit healthy volunteer subjects (HV) and subjects with clinically confirmed schizophrenia (SZ), and will establish the mean and variance across HV and SZ cohorts, sites and repeated tests, of EEG and ERP measures collected with a standardized EEG/ERP device. The study will also examine the relationship between specific EEG/ERP features and measures of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms and global function in SZ subjects.||The data collected in this study is intended to replicate published observations of the magnitude of deficit in ERPs in SZ versus HV subjects, and to support the design of subsequent interventional studies that will make use of ERPs.

"Phase 2 Trial of a Nicotinic Agonist in Schizophrenia, The objective of the trial is to determine if dosing 3-(2,4 dimethoxybenzylidene anabaseine) twice daily for 4 weeks will improve cognition and be safe. Secondary goals are to determine if these neurocognitive effects also have effects on neurobiological paradigms previously shown to be responsive to nicotinic receptor stimulation: suppression of P50 auditory evoked response, saccadic intrusions during smooth pursuit eye movements, and hemodynamic activity in the hippocampus during smooth pursuit eye movements as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. The purpose of these neurobiological measures is to assess whether the response to 3-(2,4 dimethoxybenzylidene anabaseine) is consistent with activation of nicotinic receptors. In addition, the investigators will assess clinical response using a battery of clinical assessment scales and assessments of daily living functions. The purpose of these assessments is to address the FDA requirement of a clinical effect beyond change in laboratory neuropsychological performance. This study and the subsequent two studies will also include assessments of the safety of 3-(2,4 dimethoxybenzylidene anabaseine) and related compounds.||The purpose of the trial is to lay the groundwork for Phase III investigation. If this trial finds that 3-(2,4 dimethoxybenzylidene anabaseine) has effects at a safe dose, without tachyphylaxis, then the investigators intend to proceed to a Phase III trial, where the clinical importance of this effect can be measured.||The trial will be a double blind trial with placebo control. The order of doses and placebo will be randomized.||The Phase 1 study was completed in January, 2005, with 12 non-smoking schizophrenics subjects.

"Brief Group Psychoeducation for Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a chronic persistent and disabling psychiatric syndrome whose primary feature is the presence of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech or behavior, catatonic behavior and negative symptoms (poverty of thought, social isolation, decreased expression of emotions and motivation for activities). Its incidence in one year is 15.9 per 100,000 inhabitants; its prevalence is 4.3 per 1,000 inhabitants and has been shown to be more common among men, migrant population, urban area, developed countries and greater latitude. It is associated with: 1) Increased mortality rates compared to the general population 2) Disability is one of the top ten causes of years lived with disability in people between 15 and 44 years old, which can be explained by incomplete remission of up to 80% of affected patients and psychotic relapses (5-7). 3) High economic costs given by relapses, hospitalizations, decreased labor productivity and financial and emotional burden for families (8,9). The latter has increased in the last 50 years by changes in the mental health care systems throughout the world that have left families a greater responsibility in caring for patients so they would need more knowledge about the disorder, treatment and rehabilitation (10,11). All this justifies the search for strategies aimed at preventing psychosis crisis increase the period between crises and decrease disability (12,13,14). Psychoeducation is one of the strategies that have been raised so far (15).||Psychoeducation is an intervention based on the structured and systematic knowledge acquisition of a mental disorder, with the aim of improving their clinical prognosis and reduce care costs (15,16,17). There are various designs of psychoeducative programs, they can be individual or group, involving only patients, family or both, or short (less than 10 sessions) or longer. There is insufficient evidence to establish whether any of these methods is most effective, and with respect to the psychoeducation in general, available studies suggest that it may have beneficial effect on reduction in relapses, adherence, hospital stay, global functioning and quality of life (19). However, these studies have methodological limitations such as lack of clarity in the generation and concealment of randomized allocation sequence, non-blind assessment of outcomes and frequent losses in monitoring, suggesting that the effects observed for psychoeducation may not be valid and could be overestimated. Additionally, the cultural characteristics and health system of each country may limit the applicability of studies, which may be necessary to evaluate the efficacy in sites with particular conditions (20).||In a private psychiatric clinic in Medellin primarily serving patients who belong to the contributory scheme of health care, Brief Psychoeducation Group Program was designed (five sessions) for Patients with Schizophrenia and their Families (PGSF). It was decided to include both patients and relatives because some studies suggest there may be advantages and generally patients with this disorder should go out accompanied. It will be group because some authors have argued that it could have more benefits than individual, to facilitate meetings with others, by facilitating the encounter with other people with similar conditions, which could have additional therapeutic effects and be more cost-effective (19). It will be five sessions because it was considered that they could cover the main issues and ensure the attendance at all sessions, taking into account the economic conditions and time restrictions most for most relatives. It is very important to evaluate the effectiveness of this program because that will allow making informed decisions regarding the implementation in this and other psychiatric care institutions in the country. In addition, there are not any controlled clinical trials in Colombia that evaluate the effectiveness of a psychoeducational intervention for this disorder.||Therefore, the research question is: In a psychiatric clinic of Medellin (Colombia), What is the effectiveness of a Brief Psychoeducational Group Program for Patients with Schizophrenia and their Families (PGSF) added to their Outpatient Treatment as Usual (TAU) compared with TAU to reduce the risk of relapse?, Schizophrenia|Patient Education",2
"Treatment Response in Schizophrenia: Bridging Imaging and Postmortem Studies, Our past brain imaging and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies have contributed to the understanding of specific brain regions related to treatment response to antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia. We have found that treatment response to antipsychotic medication is related to blood-flow patterns in specific regions (such as the ventral striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus). In addition, functional changes in these regions following one week of antipsychotic drug therapy are predictive of treatment response. Dr. Roberts, a neuroanatomist, has studied the post mortem (after death) brains of patients with schizophrenia while working in association with the Maryland Brain Collection. Her studies have indicated an increased number of dopaminergic synapses (that is, neurons that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine) in these regions in patients who were known to have had a favorable response to antipsychotic drug therapy. In addition, from this post-mortem work we know the number of glutamate synapses in these regions were significantly different between good treatment responders and poor responders.||From these studies we have hypothesized that in schizophrenia an over-abundance of dopamine in the ventral striatum interferes with normal functioning by limiting the transmission of glutamate. Putatively, antipsychotic medications may decrease the symptoms of schizophrenia by restoring glutamatergic activity in the ventral striatum and projected areas, such as the anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus. We have hypothesized that those individuals responding favorably to antipsychotic drug therapy will display greater glutamate activity in the ventral striatum (due to dopamine blockade) and the other regions receiving glutamate projections. This should lead to restored neuronal functioning in good responders when compared to treatment resistant and poor responders to antipsychotic drug treatment. We will test this hypothesis using complementary imaging and postmortem studies yielding data that will permit the formulation of a comprehensive model for antipsychotic drug responses in subjects with severe mental illness.||Magnetic Resonance is a technique for probing atoms and molecules based upon their interaction with an external magnetic field. Magnetic Resonance does not use ionizing radiation. The most familiar example of this is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Another application of Magnetic Resonance is called functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) allows us to measure the Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent (BOLD) response, a measure of blood flow in the brain that is known to correlate with neuronal activity. Another application of Magnetic Resonance is Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), which allows the measurements of specific metabolites such as N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), a measure of neuronal integrity, and Glutamate, which is involved in neurotransmission and metabolism. We will seek to replicate and extend our past Positron Emission Tomography (PET) findings with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using cognitive tasks that are known to activate the hippocampus (Episodic memory task) and the anterior cingulate cortex (Stroop task). This aim will further seek to parse out the differential contribution of the hippocampus and the anterior cingulate cortex to treatment response. At the same time, N-acetylaspartate, a marker of neuronal integrity, and glutamate measurements obtained with magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus will directly probe in the living brain the relation between neuronal integrity, glutamate function, and treatment response. In parallel, the postmortem work of Dr. Roberts (UAB IRB exemption: NO70813001, IRB#F080306003) will concentrate on the study of the anterior cingulate cortex in post mortem brains of schizophrenic patients. These studies should allow the development of hypotheses about the pathophysiology of treatment response and provide a basis for the interpretation of functional imaging data. The overarching goal is to identify imaging markers that will predict treatment response, and to confirm or validate these biomarkers using anatomical studies of postmortem tissue. Early detection of drug response would yield specific treatment strategies that are tailored to the individual, thus improving both the quality of life of the patients and drastically reducing the costs associated with unsuccessful treatment strategies., schizophrenia|treatment response|risperidone|functional magnetic resonance|functional magnetic spectroscopy",2

"Treatment Study for Cognitive Deficits in Schizophrenia, The proposed study is a multicenter, randomized, double blind comparison of MK-0777 GEM 3 mg BID, MK-0777 GEM 8 mg BID, and placebo. The total sample will consist of 90 clinically stable patients with DSM IV TR schizophrenia, with 30 subjects randomized to each group. A best estimate diagnostic approach will be utilized, in which information from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) (First et al, 1997) is supplemented by information from family informants, previous psychiatrists, and medical records to generate a diagnosis. The projected number of subjects to be recruited from each site is 12-13. There will be a 2 week, placebo lead-in evaluation phase, in which subjects will undergo baseline diagnostic; medical, including a physical examination, EKG (electrocardiogram), CBC (Complete Blood Count), complete metabolic panel, urine toxicology, and UA (urinalysis); psychiatric; and neurocognitive, symptom level and functional capacity and patient self-report of cognitive function assessments. In addition, all subjects will receive a slit-lamp eye examination. At the end of the evaluation phase, subjects will be randomized to one of two MK-0777 doses or placebo. The double-blind treatment phase will be 4 weeks. Subjects will receive bi-weekly symptom assessments and weekly side effect and vital sign assessments. At week 4, subjects will undergo repeat administration of the neuropsychological test battery and the functional capacity and patient self-report of cognitive function measures. These assessments will be done over a two-day period. Subjects will have blood samples collected for antipsychotic and MK-0777 levels at week 4. An EKG (electrocardiogram) will be obtained at the end of the double-blind study. Slit-lamp eye examinations will be conducted at study completion, 6 months and 12 months after study completion. After the completion of the 4-week double-blind phase, there will be a 4-day follow-up phase during which subjects will be tapered off study medication.||Study Locations: The study will be conducted in the Treatment Units for Research on Neurocognition and Schizophrenia (TURNS) study network, which is comprised of seven sites: Columbia University School of Medicine (P.I.: Jeffrey Lieberman, M.D.); Duke University School of Medicine (P.I.: Joseph McEvoy, M.D.); Harvard University School of Medicine (P.I.: Donald Goff, M.D.); Maryland Psychiatric Research Center (MPRC) (P.I.: Robert W. Buchanan, M.D.); Nathan Kline Institute (P.I.: Daniel Javitt, M.D.) University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine (P.I.: Steve Marder, M.D.); and Washington University School of Medicine (P.I.: John Csernansky, M.D.). The TURNS is a NIMH-funded contract for the evaluation of new compounds for the treatment of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia (HHSN 27820044 1003C; P.I.: Steve Marder, M.D.). Data management will be performed by the Clinical Trials Data Management Unit of the Nathan Kline Institute under the direction of Jim Robinson, M.S., and statistical analysis will be performed by Dr. Robert McMahon of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center. Laboratory assays will be performed by Quest Diagnostics.||Procedures:||Clinical Assessments: The symptom assessments will include the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS); Calgary Depression Scale (CDS); and Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI).||i) BPRS(Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale): the four positive symptom items (conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content) will be used to measure positive psychotic symptoms.||ii) SANS (Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms): the SANS total score, minus the global items, inappropriate affect, poverty of content of speech, and attention items, will be used to measure negative symptoms. The inappropriate affect, poverty of content of speech, and attention items are excluded as lacking construct validity and because factor analytic study results suggest that these items are not closely related to negative symptoms.||iii) CDS (Calgary Depression Scale): the CDS total score will be used to measure depressive symptoms.||iv) CGI (Clinical Global Impressions): the CGI severity of illness item will be used to assess global changes||Safety Assessments: The safety assessments will include the Simpson Angus Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (SAS); Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS); and Side Effect Checklist (SEC).||i) SAS: a modified 11 item version of the SAS will be used to assess EPS. ii) AIMS: is a 12 item scale, with 7 items designed to assess abnormal facial, oral, extremity, and trunk movements; 3 global judgment items; and 2 current dental status items.||iii) SEC: is designed to assess vital signs, commonly occurring antipsychotic side effects, and side effects indicative of uveitis or cataracts.||Subjects will be asked about adverse events at each visit, and instructed to call the study site should they experience adverse events at any point in the study. Any serious adverse event, including death due to any cause, which occurs to any subject entered into this study or within 14 days following cessation of treatment, whether or not related to the investigational product, will be reported to Merck & Co., Inc. within 24 hours.||Functional Assessments: The functional assessments will include the UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA) and the Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS).||i) UPSA: is designed to assess skills in five areas: household chores, communication, finance, transportation, and planning recreational activities. Subjects are asked to perform tasks in each of these areas and scored according to their ability to complete the task. The UPSA takes 25 - 30 minutes to administer.||ii) SCoRS: is a rating scale designed to elicit information from the subject and informant on the level of cognitive function of the subject. The subject and informant versions both have 20 items. Subject and informant interviews take from 10 - 15 minutes to complete.||Neurocognitive Assessments: The NIMH MATRICS (Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Research) Neuropsychological Battery, the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR), the N-Back test; and the Continuous Performance Test (CPT-AX) will be used to assess cognitive function. The NIMH MATRICS Neuropsychological Battery is comprised of measures of: a) working memory; b) attention/vigilance; c) verbal memory; d) visual memory; e) processing speed; f) problem solving; and g) social cognition. The N-Back and CPT-AX are both computerized measures of prefrontal cortex dependent cognitive behavior.||Screening: The diagnosis of schizophrenia will be confirmed by a research psychiatrist using a modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID). The BPRS, SANS, CDRS and SAS will be administered to verify that inclusionary criteria are met. Subjects will have a slit-lamp eye examination.||2 Week, Lead-in Evaluation Phase: In the 2 week lead-in evaluation phase, subjects will receive placebo. They will undergo baseline symptom, medical, safety, and neurocognitive assessments. The subjects will undergo a physical examination; including neurological exam, an EKG; and laboratory tests of major organ functions (i.e., CBC (complete blood count), liver function tests, electrolytes, glucose, BUN/Creatinine, Urinalysis (UA), urine toxicology, and thyroid functions). Baseline antipsychotic levels will be collected. All women will have a pregnancy test, unless they are either surgically or hormonally post menopausal.||4-Week Double Blind Treatment Phase: The study is a 4-week, placebo controlled, double blind study. Subjects will be randomized to either: MK-0777 GEM 3mg BID; MK-0777 GEM 8mg BID; or placebo. The unblinded site pharmacist will be notified of the treatment assignment, and will dispense study medication. Subjects will receive biweekly symptom assessments and weekly side effect and vital sign assessments. At week 4, subjects will undergo repeat administration of the neuropsychological test battery and the functional capacity and patient self-report of cognitive function measures. These assessments will be done over a two-day period. At week 4, subjects will also undergo a repeat slit lamp eye examination. We will also attempt to contact and schedule subjects who dropped out of the study prior to week 4 for the week 4 slit lamp eye examination. Finally, subjects will have blood samples collected for antipsychotic and MK-0777 levels at week 4.||6-Month and 12-Month Follow-up Evaluations: All subjects, regardless if they completed the 4-week double-blind treatment phase, will be contacted and scheduled for follow-up slit lamp eye examinations.||Randomization: Subjects will be randomly assigned to placebo or one of two doses of experimental treatment within strata defined by site.||Recruitment: Recruitment for potential subjects will be performed by reviewing subject records to determine eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once qualifying records have been identified, potential subjects will be informed individually and/or in a group setting about the study., Cognition|Schizophrenia",2

"Effects of Eszopiclone on Sleep and Memory in Schizophrenia, Sleep spindles, a defining oscillation of stage 2 non-rapid eye movement sleep (N2), are strongly linked to memory and IQ in healthy individuals. Schizophrenia is characterized by a spindle deficit that correlates with deficient sleep-dependent memory consolidation, symptom severity, IQ and executive function. In a small pilot study of schizophrenia patients, eszopiclone , significantly increased sleep spindles but its effect on memory was not significant. Here, in a larger double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design study, we investigated whether eszopiclone can both increase spindle density and improve memory consolidation. Chronic, medicated schizophrenia outpatients and demographically-matched healthy control participants were randomly assigned to receive either placebo first or 3mg of eszopiclone first for two consecutive nights with high density polysomnography.

"Effectiveness of Vitamin Supplementation in Treating People With Residual Symptoms of Schizophrenia, About 30% of people with schizophrenia suffer from treatment-resistant psychotic symptoms, which may include social withdrawal, apathy, and depression. These negative symptoms can produce substantial distress for those affected, often disrupting social and occupational functioning and resulting in hospitalization. Although atypical antipsychotic medications have demonstrated some success in treating negative symptoms, the degree to which many negative symptoms respond is unclear. Depression and poor response to antidepressant medication have been linked to deficiency in the vitamins folate and B12. It is believed that vitamin supplementation with folate and B12 may offer a safe and inexpensive approach to improve outcomes for people with schizophrenia who have residual negative symptoms and have exhibited poor treatment response. This study will compare the effectiveness of folate and B12 versus placebo in reducing negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia.||Participation in this double-blind study will last 19 weeks. Potential participants will undergo initial screening, which will include a medical and psychiatric evaluation, physical exam, blood draw, urine sampling, and questionnaires. Participants will also be asked for permission to use a portion of the blood sample for genetic analysis. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to take folate with B12 or placebo. Participants will first complete a 2-week stabilization phase, followed by the 16-week treatment study. Medication visits, occurring every 2 weeks during treatment, will include questions about medication side effects and the distribution of study medication. During specified medication visits, participants will complete various assessments, which will include questionnaires about schizophrenia, tests of learning and memory, repeat blood tests, and pregnancy tests.

"Risk Prediction Model of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a common severe mental disorder with high rate of disability, which seriously affects patients' life.It is necessary to take long-term therapy to control symptoms or prevent recurrence. Studies have found that schizophrenia patients live on average ten to twenty-five years less than others. The main reason for high rates of mortality and disability is the high risk of cardiovascular events.There are few domestic large-scale studys on the risk of cardiovascular events in schizophrenia, thus they have not formed objective tools to assess cardiovascular risk. If this risk can be objectively assessed and predicted at an early stage, it is expected to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and thus reduce mortality.At present, there are mature tools for assessing the risk of cardiovascular events in patients, such as Framingham, PRIMROSE, etc.The latter is the new tool for assessing cardiovascular events in patients with severe mental disorders. This study used a retrospective cohort design to collect the history of hospitalized schizophrenia patients within 2 years, collect relevant informations about cardiovascular events. The investigators validate the PRIMROSE model in China and explore the risk prediction model of cardiovascular events in schizophrenia patients., 0",2

"Will Decreased Noradrenergic Activity Normalize Information Processing in Patients With Schizophrenia?, A number of reports in literature provide evidence for, among others, an increased central noradrenergic activity in schizophrenia. In addition to this increased noradrenergic activity, patients with schizophrenia often show reduced filtering of sensory information, which is reflected in reduced P50 suppression and reduced prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex (PPI). In two separate initial studies in our laboratory, we found reduced sensory gating following administration of imipramine (a combined noradrenergic and serotonergic agonist) and desipramine (a highly specific noradrenergic agonist) to healthy volunteers. This provides evidence for a direct causal relation between the increased noradrenergic activity and the disturbed gating of sensory information, as both commonly found in patients with schizophrenia. Therefore, in a follow-up study, the effects of a noradrenergic antagonist will be investigated on the sensory gating of patients with schizophrenia. To further extend the data of our initial studies, the patients will additionally be tested for two psychophysiological parameters of attention that are usually found to be disturbed in patients with schizophrenia, i.e. mismatch negativity and selective attention. The design will conform to a double blind, placebo controlled experiment, in which either four doses (0.25 ug, 50 ug, 75 ug or 150 ug)of clonidine or placebo will be added to the current medical treatment of 20 male patients with schizophrenia on five occasions, separated by at least a week, after which they are tested in the Copenhagen Psychophysiological Test Battery (CPTB).In order to test the effects of clonidine in healthy volunteers, 20 healthy males will receive a fixed dose of 0.15 mg clonidine or placebo on two separate occasions separated by at least a week, after which they will be tested in the CPTB as well., Schizophrenia|Information processing|PPI|P50 gating|P300|mismatch negativity|clonidine",2

"Paired Associative Stimulation in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex in Patients With Schizophrenia, Neuroplasticity refers to changes in the strength of communication between different neurons. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is one form of neuroplasticity and refers to the strengthening of such communication. LTP is believed to be a cellular substrate of learning and memory. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) is a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm that is believed to induce LTP in human subjects. However, its effects have been shown to be minimal in patients with schizophrenia suggesting impaired LTP in schizophrenia. The lack of PAS effect in schizophrenia has been observed in the motor cortex (M1). Thus, the investigators propose to assess the effect of PAS in schizophrenia in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), an area of the brain that is especially relevant to learning and memory, and to the pathology in schizophrenia. The investigators also propose to assess the effect of PAS induced LTP on the performance of patients with schizophrenia on a cognitive task that is related to DLFPC.||Hypothesis 1: Patients with schizophrenia will have reduced PAS-LTP in DLPFC in comparison with healthy controls.||Hypothesis 2a: PAS-LTP in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls randomized to PAS-25 and PAS-100 will correlate with performance on the N-back task at baseline (pre-PAS).||Hypothesis 2b: Healthy controls randomized to PAS-25 will perform better after one session of PAS-25 on the 1- and 7-day N-back task compared to healthy controls randomized to PAS-100.||Hypothesis 2c: Among healthy controls randomized to PAS-25, the magnitude of improvement on the 1- and 7-day N-back task (compared to pre-PAS) that is in excess of the magnitude of improvement on the 1- and 7-day N-back task among subjects randomized to PAS-100 will correlate with the degree of PAS-LTP.||Hypothesis 3a: Patients with schizophrenia who are randomized to receive a 2-week course of PAS-25 will have improved PAS-LTP in DLPFC compared to patients with schizophrenia randomized to 2-week course of PAS-100.||Hypothesis 3b: Patients with schizophrenia who are randomized to receive a 2-week course of PAS-25 will have improved performance on the N-back working memory task compared to patients with schizophrenia randomized to 2-week PAS-100 at 1- and 7-day post-PAS course N-back.||Hypothesis 3c: Patients with schizophrenia who are randomized to receive a 2-week course of PAS-25 will have increased DLPFC cortical thickness compared to patients with schizophrenia randomized to 2-week PAS-100.||Hypothesis 4: Among patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, PAS-LTP will decrease with age, and the decrease will be more pronounced in healthy controls than in patients., Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)|Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC)|Schizophrenia|Working Memory|Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS)|Electroencephalography (EEG)|Cognition",2

"An Efficacy and Safety Study of One Dosage of Paliperidone Extended Release (ER) in Treating Patients With Schizophrenia, Currently, treatment of acute symptoms in schizophrenia is less than ideal, up to one-third of patients with schizophrenia do not respond to current treatments, and poor drug tolerability can decrease a patient's ability to remain on treatment. Paliperidone ER doses in the range of 3 mg/day to 12 mg/day have been approved for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. A lower dosage form of paliperidone ER be efficacious and may reduce the risk of certain adverse effects. This study will evaluate the efficacy of 1 fixed (ie, it does not change during the study) dosage of paliperidone ER (1.5 mg/day) compared with placebo. One fixed dosage of paliperidone ER (6.0 mg/day) will be given to some patients as an active (it has already been shown to have efficacy) control. This is a multicenter, double-blind (neither the patient nor the study-site personnel know which treatment the patient is receiving), randomized (patients are assigned to a treatment group by chance), placebo-controlled (some patients will receive placebo and no active drug), parallel-group (patients in all groups follow the same study design) study in adults who were diagnosed with schizophrenia at least 1 year before screening and who are experiencing an acute episode. The study starts with an up-to-5-day screening phase to find out if the patient is eligible for the study. The screening phase includes a 3- to 5-day washout (the medication dosage is tapered down and finally stopped) of any medications that are being taken by a patient but that are not allowed during the study. A 6-week double-blind treatment phase follows and finishes with an end-of-study visit. A post-study visit to collect additional safety data will be scheduled for 1 week after a patient receives his or her last dose of study drug. The length of the entire study is about 8 weeks. Patients who withdraw from the study before completing the double-blind treatment phase will complete the end-of-study visit procedures at the time they withdraw and the post-study visit 1 week after receiving their last dose of study drug. For all patients leaving the study, the investigator will make every effort to see that they receive adequate continuity of care. At baseline (the visit just before a patient takes the first dose of study drug), all patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 possible treatment groups to receive paliperidone ER 1.5 mg/day, paliperidone ER 6 mg/day, or placebo once daily for 6 weeks. Patients must be voluntary inpatients at the time of randomization, and they must remain in the hospital for a minimum of 8 days. Efficacy will be measured using the following rating scales: the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP), and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey-36 (MOS SF-36). Safety will be evaluated using physical examinations, ECGs, clinical laboratory testing (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), testings for pregnancy, and monitoring for adverse events including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), and Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SAS). The study hypothesis is that Paliperidone ER at 1.5 mg per day will be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia as measured by the change in total PANSS score between baseline and endpoint in comparison with placebo.

"Study With Information Technology (IT) - Aided Preventive Program in Schizophrenia, Title of Study:||ITAREPS Trial: A Prospective Randomized Double-blind Controlled Study in IT-aided Mobile Phone-based Relapse Prevention Program in Schizophrenia.||Estimated Number of Study Centers and Countries:||30-40 outpatient psychiatrists in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic.||Research Hypothesis:||Information Technology-aided Program of Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia (ITAREPS) will decrease the number of hospitalizations in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are treated in the outpatient psychiatric setting, as evidenced by the reduction of the total number of hospitalizations due to relapse of psychosis at the end of the 12-months follow-up period in the active ITAREPS group compared to the control (treatment-as-usual) group.||Study Phase:||Non Drug Interventional Study||Study Objective:||To evaluate effectiveness of the ITAREPS program in reduction of the number of hospitalizations due to relapse of psychosis. The ITAREPS program employs mobile phone communication between the psychiatrist and the patient. Subjects enrolled in the project (patient and his/her family member) are instructed to complete two separate versions of the 10-item Early Warning Signs Questionnaire (EWSQ) upon a weekly SMS request sent automatically by the system. EWSQ detects proportional worsening (or a new onset) of psychotic symptoms compared to the last week's score of the completed questionnaire. Individual EWSQ scores are sent by the subjects back to the ITAREPS system as a SMS text message. If the EWSQ score exceeds given score thresholds, an immediate ALERT requesting a therapeutic intervention is announced to the investigator as an e-mail message and a timely pharmacological intervention is triggered in accordance with the Early Intervention Algorithm (EIA).||Study design:||This is an international, randomized, double-blind, controlled, design-blinded, non drug, interventional study. Subjects (patient and family member pairs) will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio into the interventional or control group. All subjects will complete the EWSQ on a weekly basis. In the interventional group, e-mail alert message feedback to the investigator will be active and the investigator will react by using the EIA. In the control (treatment-as-usual) group, alerts will not be generated and the investigator will detect and react on the potential signs of the psychotic relapse only by using the standard clinical approach. The ALERTs will be reported to the investigators in approximately 50% of all ALERT events but the investigators and subjects will be kept blinded about the real study design - parallel or (multiple) cross-over. The type of the study design is specified only in section 3.1.1. of the protocol. This section will not be available to the investigators and will be provided only for the purpose of the regulatory and ethics review.||Study duration: 12 months||Number of subjects:||150 enrolled patient/family member pairs (i.e. 300 subjects) resulting in expected 120 evaluable patient/family member pairs (i.e. 240 subjects) will be participating in the study.||Study population:||Male and female patients between 18 to 60 having ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and their healthy family members, both eligible for mobile phone communicating.||Statistical Methods:||The primary effectiveness analysis will be a comparison of the upper bound of 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean number of hospitalizations in patients in the active ITAREPS group at month 12 compared to the control (treatment-as-usual) group.

"Disturbances of Kynurenine Pathway of Trytophan Metabolism in Schizophrenia: A Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Study, In this pilot study, we propose to characterize the pattern of activation of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism in peripheral macrophages of patients with schizophrenia. To do this, we will measure the gene expression of several major enzymes in this pathway in macrophages, including the key enzyme involved in tryptophan to kynurenine metabolism, IDO, by means of quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The focus on enzyme mRNA expression as opposed to serum or cerebrospinal fluid levels of metabolites provides a possibly more sensitive characterization of the activation of this metabolic pathway.||Primary hypotheses: We hypothesize that patients with schizophrenia will differ in their expression of macrophage IDO mRNA, reflecting activation of this pathway compared to normals. We further hypothesize that patients with deficit syndrome will have higher degrees of enzyme activation.||Secondary hypotheses: Serum tryptophan levels will be lower in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls, and they will correlate with measures of dysphoria. Serum kynurenine levels will be elevated in patients with schizophrenia, particularly in deficit syndrome patients. mRNA expression levels of enzymes downstream from IDO will differ between patients and controls. Measures of immune activation will be influenced by medical disease burden (medical comorbidities)., Schizophrenia|Immune System|Kynurenate|tryptophan metabolism|NMDA receptor|indolamine 2,3-deoxygenase (IDO)",2
"Cognitive Factors Mediating the Relationship Between Childhood Trauma and Auditory Hallucinations in Schizophrenia, BACKGROUND A first generation of research has demonstrated strong associations between trauma suffered in childhood (physical, psychological and sexual violence) and having schizophrenia, and more specifically to experience ""hearing voices"" (acoustic-verbal hallucinations, AVH).||A second generation of research is currently examining the cognitive and affective processes likely to play a mediating role in this association. These mediators appear to include early maladaptive personality patterns and dissociative experiences. Although these factors have most often been explored separately, recent research indicates that they could be associated, and thus contribute to AVH. More specifically, another study has shown that the association between childhood trauma and predisposition to AVH is not direct but depends on cognitive factors including the impact of violence suffered during childhood on early maladaptive schemas (for example, interpersonal functioning centred on ""subjugation"", ""abandonment"", ""vulnerability"") and dissociation. However, this study was carried out on a non-clinical sample of subjects with a predisposition to AVH OBJECTIVES Here, aim is at testing a structural model of AVH, childhood trauma, early maladaptive schemas and dissociative symptoms in large sample of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and AVH (n=350).||Secondary objectives are (i) to carry out exploratory analyzes which will allow investigators to test in the model the role of all the early patterns described by Jeffrey Young instead of targeting only the schemes that are part of the model tested in previous study as the one by Bortolon and colleagues, (ii) compare the quality of the adjustment of the confirmatory model to the quality of the adjustment of the exploratory model.||METHODS||A cross-sectional, multicenter design (3 centres) will be performed. Patients included will be diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and experience AVH at the time of the inclusion (n= 350). All will be inpatients.

"Using D-cycloserine to Enhance the Benefits of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a debilitating chronic condition that affects approximately 1 % of Americans, who experience symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorders of thought and movement. These symptoms are described as positive symptoms, because they are experienced in addition to what healthy individuals experience. Negative symptoms, which are reductions in normal functioning, and cognitive deficits, which are problems in thinking, also plague people with schizophrenia. The negative symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia are produced in otherwise healthy people by neurotransmitters inhibiting the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate NMDA receptors in the brain. This inhibition of NMDA receptors also causes intensification of psychotic symptoms in otherwise stabilized schizophrenic patients. The drug D-cycloserine partially excites NMDA receptors, and it has been used to help patients with anxiety disorders to overcome phobias while they are receiving cognitive behavioral therapy. This study will examine whether D-cycloserine can increase the cognitive flexibility of someone undergoing CBT and thereby enhance the therapy's ability to reduce a patient's belief in paranoid delusions, preoccupation with delusions, and related distress.||All participants will be screened to ensure proper diagnosis of schizophrenia without other conditions. Those who pass will be randomly assigned to receive either D-cycloserine first or a placebo pill first. One week after the screening, participants in the D-cycloserine group will be given the drug before a 1-hour session of simulated CBT treatment. Those in the placebo condition will receive a placebo pill before an identical session. Two weeks after the screening, both groups will be called back for another session of CBT, but the pills they receive will be switched. Those who received D-cycloserine the first week will receive placebo, and those who received placebo will receive D-cycloserine. The CBT sessions will attempt to increase cognitive flexibility in patients by asking them to provide alternate explanations for common situations. At screening, at the start of visits on the first and second weeks, and at a follow-up visit on the third week, participants will undergo a series of assessments, including interviews, computerized tests, and self-report measures. Belief in, preoccupation with, and distress caused by delusions, as well as degree of cognitive flexibility, will be assessed., Paranoid Schizophrenia|Paranoid Delusions|CBT|D-Cycloserine",2

"Cognitive Remediation Plus Aerobic Exercise in Schizophrenia Treatment, Cognitive remediation (CR) and physical exercise have separately shown promising results in schizophrenia cognitive improvement, despite this, the impact in improving functionality is still limited. Physical exercise increases Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels, promoting neuronal and cognitive plasticity, which can maximize the impact of CR. The aim of this project is to study the efficacy of an intensive program (3 months) that combines CR and physical exercise by a randomized controlled trial where 74 patients with chronic schizophrenia will be randomized to two groups: 1) CR plus physical exercise; 2) CR plus control activity (health promotion). Primary outcome measures will be cognitive performance, functional outcome, negative symptoms and BDNF levels. Measures will be blindly assessed at baseline, at 3 months follow up and at 15 months follow up. The investigators expect that: i) the CR plus physical exercise will be superior to CR plus control activity in improving cognition, functional outcome, negative symptoms and in increasing BDNF levels in the short and medium term (3 and 15 months); ii) changes in BDNF levels after the CR plus physical exercise will be an adequate biomarker of the cognitive improvement obtained with this treatment., 0",2
"Minocycline Augmentation in Schizophrenia, Minocycline, which is a second-generation tetracycline, has been found to inhibit Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) and inflammatory cytokines. These are some of the primary mechanisms that have been proposed to explain its neuroprotective and neuroplastic effects in several animal and human models of neurological and psychiatric diseases, including Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. There are only three clinical trials with minocycline in schizophrenia subjects. A more definitive clinical trial in a larger sample with optimized and cost-effective design using a comprehensive cognitive battery and a global assessment of schizophrenia symptom domains is necessary to examine the efficacy of minocycline. If minocycline improves psychopathology and potentially other symptoms (including cognitive function) for schizophrenia, the treatment could be easily implemented in the existing treatment delivery system at relatively low cost and have the potential for making a significant public health impact. The investigators plan to recruit 120 individuals with early course schizophrenia who are currently on second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medications and are experiencing persistent symptoms in at least the moderate range. In an effort to limit placebo response, which is notoriously high in psychiatric population, the investigators are using an adaptive design. Since, there is growing evidence to support the inflammatory hypothesis of schizophrenia, the investigators will also explore whether cytokine levels mediate the response from minocycline treatment., minocycline, augmentation, schizophrenia",2

"Evaluation of the Role of Neurodegeneration in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a progressive and complex psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 1%, usually diagnosed between the ages of 20-25, its etiology is not fully understood, and it progresses with relapses. In addition to positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior, and negative symptoms such as affective blunting, anhedonia, and avulsion, impairment in social and occupational functionality and cognitive impairment can be observed.||The incidence of schizophrenia in relatives of individuals with schizophrenia is higher than in the general population. Although heredity is a strong component in the etiology of schizophrenia, environmental exposures and stressors such as maternal immune infection, obstetric complications, childhood trauma and cannabis exposure also play a role in the development and neuropathology of the disease. Hereditary risk and the interactions of these exposures with the genomic sequence form the basis of the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia.||The neurodevelopmental hypothesis proposes that disruption of brain development early in life is responsible for the onset of symptoms. According to the neurodevelopmental hypothesis, although the biological changes and other features of the disease are present in the patient long before the onset of the characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia, these symptoms will not appear in the patient until a certain level of development is reached by interacting with some factors.||Detection of some brain findings such as decreased cortical volume, ventricular enlargement, and altered gyrification patterns in the imaging findings in the initial period of schizophrenia supports the view that some changes in the brain can be seen even before the onset of schizophrenia, but in this view, no worsening of the damage in the brain is expected. Therefore, the neurodevelopmental model falls short of addressing the progressive brain damage observed in patients with chronic schizophrenia Studies show a worsening clinical course in 60% of patients with schizophrenia. The neurodegenerative hypothesis focuses on the fact that biochemical changes in schizophrenia are characterized by chronic and progressive impairment of the nervous system, leading to different clinical syndromes, loss of neurological function and behavioral disorders. It is thought that the presence of changes in the brain morphology of patients with schizophrenia in various studies indicates degeneration. In brain imaging, changes such as decrease in temporal lobe and frontal lobe volume, enlargement in the lateral ventricles and third ventricle, hippocampal atrophy have been detected. Changes in these areas of the brain indicate loss of white and gray matter. Detection of these differences in the first psychotic attacks and early-onset patients; suggests that the degenerative process starts from the earliest stages of the disorder. In addition, it has been shown that the difference between brain imaging of healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia increases with age.||Following the clinical onset of schizophrenia, patients differ significantly in disease course. Relapse is associated with significant psychological and social distress as well as increased economic burden in patients with schizophrenia and their families. Good response to antipsychotic drug and low optimal antipsychotic dose in patients with first episode schizophrenia; This suggests that relapse reduces drug response, and that the increase in the number of attacks is associated with resistance to treatment in schizophrenia. The state of not responding adequately to treatment is defined as resistance to treatment, and the most comprehensive definition of the concept of Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia (TFS) was made by Kane, and it was named ""Kane Criteria"". Kane Criteria Criteria for resistance to treatment applied in the past; Failure to respond to at least three antipsychotic treatments at 1000mg/day chlorpromazine or equivalent dose for six weeks in the previous five years. Lack of a good functioning period in the last five years. Criterion of severity of psychopathology; A Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score of 45 and above, At least two of the 4 positive symptoms of BPRS (thought disorientation, skepticism, hallucinatory behavior, unusual thoughts) are 4 and above, Clinical General Impression (CGI) score is 4 and above Prospective treatment non-response criteria; Unresponsive to haloperidol therapy up to 60 mg/day. (Response to treatment was defined as a BPRS score of more than 20% and a CGI score of 3 or less, or a BPRS score of 35 or less). Diagnosis of Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia in Clinical Practice - A history of two antipsychotic treatments - At least 6 weeks on an antipsychotic and at least 600 mg Chlorpromazine equivalent dose - Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (CPRS) ≥45 - Positive and Negative Syndrome Global Scale (PANNS) ≥75 - Clinical Impression Scale-Severity of Disease (CGI-HȘ) ≥ 4 - General Evaluation of Functioning (IGD) ≤50 In psychiatry, the diagnosis is made based on the evaluation of signs and symptoms in the clinical interview, and there is no biological ""gold standard"" diagnosis. It has been shown that in patients with first episode schizophrenia, each episode lasts longer than the previous episode, and relapse is associated with progressive loss of cortical tissue and brain volume. Relapse is an expression of worsening psychopathology and it is thought that some neurobiological pathways may cause relapse. The glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP, which is one of the reactive astrocyte-specific biomarkers indicating astrogliosis, is not released from the healthy astrocyte. The increase in GFAP indicates damage and inflammation in the astrocyte. It is also secreted in different amounts from different parts of the brain. GFAP can be measured in serum in proportion to the degree of damage by passing into the blood circulation as a result of astrocyte damage. One of the cytoskeletal components (GFAP), it has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and is thought to play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia and is one of the potential markers of neurodegeneration and progression in schizophrenia. In a study measuring the amount of serum GFAP in patients with schizophrenia and healthy volunteers, GFAP was found to be high in the schizophrenia group, but it was noted that it was higher especially in patients using clozapine.||The S100B protein is a member of the calcium-binding protein group and is secreted from many cells, such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, certain neuronal populations, adipocytes, or lymphocyte populations. This protein is released from stimulated or damaged astrocytes into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and crosses the blood-brain barrier and enters the peripheral circulation. The S100B protein (depending on its level) can have a trophic or toxic effect on surrounding neurons, astrocytes, or microglia. At low concentration, S100B ensures neuron survival, but at higher level it leads to neuronal cell apoptosis and is associated with brain damage or neurodegeneration. Various brain tumors, neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders, psychiatric diseases and even major cardiac events have been investigated. Serum and cerebrospinal concentrations of S100B are found to be high in schizophrenia, which is thought to indicate activation of astrocytes or loss of oligodenrocytes. Studies in cell culture and experiments with ligands have shown that S100B can increase dopaminergic neurotransmission. With the pathogenesis of the disease, varying concentrations of S100B in patients with schizophrenia; It is thought that the binding of S100B to the D2 receptor leads to a decrease in glutamate concentration at synapses as a result of increased signal transduction and increased glutamate uptake in astrocytes, and may also be related to the role of S100B in neuronal apoptosis in many different ways.||Data Collection and Evaluation Scales||Sociodemographic and Clinical Data Form:|The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)|Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)|Clinical Global Impression (CGI)|General Evaluation of Functioning (IGD)|STANDARDIZED MINI MENTAL TEST (SMMT) or MODIFIED MINI MENTAL TEST (MMSE-E) FOR THE UNEDUCTED, schizophrenia, neurodegeneration, s100b, gfap",2

"Effect of Sarcosine on Symptomatology, Quality of Life, Oxidative Stress and Glutamatergic Parameters in Schizophrenia, Glutamic acid is the largest excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, the population of glutamatergic neurones represents approximately 50% of all neurones in the brain. Being closely dependent on the inhibitory GABA system, the glutamate system is responsible for the transmission and modulation of the majority of brain signals and connected with dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. The glutamate system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. NMDA receptor antagonists, including phencyclidine, ketamine and MK-801, cause symptoms similar to those found in schizophrenia, as well as deterioration of mental state in patients with schizophrenia. What is important from a theoretical point of view NMDA agonists also cause negative symptoms which are not observed after amphetamine or other drugs intoxications. Based on these observations, it was assumed that normalization of glutamatergic transmission may result in an improvement in schizophrenia symptomatology.||According to the assumptions of this hypothesis, attempts were made to stimulate transmission within this system. Due to the high risk of excitotoxic effects induction therapy with glutamic acid is not administered (hyperactivity of glutamatergic system, leading to nerve cell damage was observed in neurodegenerative diseases). Along with glutamic acid and voltage changes dependent on another glutamatergic receptor - AMPA, presence of glycine is necessary to stimulate the NMDA receptor. This widely distributed amino acid, an important element of protein chains, is present in a daily diet (average consumption amounts to 2g/day). In addition to building properties, it is of paramount importance in the central nervous system. As a primary transmitter in glycinergic neurones it belongs to the class I of neurotransmitters. Moreover, it also plays a role as a co-agonist and a modulator, for example in the glutamatergic system. Glutamic acid is released from nerve endings into the synaptic cleft, where it is re-uptaken and dispersed, which, in consequence, results in a rapid decline in its concentration in the vicinity of NMDA receptors. As a result, the time of receptor binding is short. Intrasynaptic glycine turnover is different - it resides inside the synapses permanently, depending on the concentration and, to a greater or lesser extent, binds to a modulatory site. Glial cells, with identified glycine transport system (GlyT-1) are responsible for maintaining a stable level of glycine in neuronal junctions. New research on inhibitors of this transport system (GTI) eg. sarcosine, which may have similar or better effects to glycine administration, have begun. Glycine does not bind to all the modulatory sites on NMDA receptor in vivo, and augmentation of this saturation intensifies glutamatergic transmission. This phenomenon is particularly observed in individuals with relatively low (not sufficient for maximum saturation of the receptor site) levels of synaptic glycine.||We hypothesize that supplementation of sarcosine helps achieve betterment in symptomatology, general quality of life and also cognitive functioning and other prefrontal derivatives, eg. oculomotor functions.||To extend research we planned assessing blood levels of glycine, sarcosine but also other parameters involved in glutamatergic transmission such as BDNF and metalproteinase MMP-9. Knowing excitotoxic properties of glutamate TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) - oxidative stress related will be assessed.||Methodology of the study. We plan to enroll 60-70 patients in stable mental state meeting criteria for schizophrenia according to ICD-10 with predominant negative symptoms (minimum of 21 points and severity of each negative symptom at least 3 points in PANSS-Negative subscale).||Main study part will be continued for 26 weeks (T0-T26) and 10 visits (W1-W10). The preceding 12-week period (W0-W1) will be used for evaluation of stability of mental state and pharmacotherapy.||Patients on visit T0 will be randomized to two comparable groups of 30 patients (sarcosine and control group). Researchers and patients will not have information on the administered treatment.||During the study patients will receive previous antipsychotic treatment (at least 3-month without dosage change). Mental stability will be assessed during the preceding period (W1 and W0 visit - 12 weeks before W1). Sarcosine (or placebo) will be augmented between visits W1 and W9, the subsequent period (between W9 and W10), will be used to evaluate the consequences of withdrawal sarcosine (and placebo).||Information on the history of the disease, and current mental status will be obtained during the psychiatric examination, in part, standardized by the use of commonly accepted psychiatric scales (PANSS, Calgary Depression Scale, CGI, SAS and quality of life and sexual activity scales). Assessment of the use of psychiatric scales will be used on each of the visits.||As the basic tools used to study cognitive functioning test Wisconsin Card Sorting (WCST), Trail Making Test (TMT) and Stroop Test will be used.

"Monotherapy of an NMDA Enhancer for Schizophrenia, Several lines of evidence suggest that schizophrenia is associated with accelerated aging and oxidative stress may play a role. Cognitive deficits are core symptoms of accelerated aging in patients with schizophrenia and the most difficult domain to treat. Current antipsychotics have limited, if any, efficacy for cognitive function. Previous studies found that some NMDA-enhancing agent was able to augment antioxidant activity and its adjunctive therapy was better than placebo in reducing not only clinical symptoms but also cognitive deficits and revealed favorable safety in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Of note, a substantial portion of schizophrenia patients refuse or cannot tolerate antipsychotics due to poor response or severe side effects. This study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of NMDAE monotherapy for the treatment of schizophrenia. The investigators enroll patients with schizophrenia who refuse or are unable to tolerate antipsychotics due to poor response or adverse effects into a 6-week randomized, double-blind trial to receive monotherapy of NMDAE or placebo. The investigators biweekly measure clinical performances and side effects. Cognitive functions are assessed at baseline and at endpoint of treatment by a battery of tests. The efficacies of NMDAE and placebo will be compared.||Chi-square (or Fisher's exact test) will be used to compare differences of categorical variables and t-test (or Mann-Whitney test if the distribution is not normal) for continuous variables between treatment groups.

"Antidepressant Controlled Trial for Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia, The negative symptoms of schizophrenia represent an important dimension of psychopathology, and reflect the absence or diminution of normal behaviours and functions. They include deficiencies in emotional responsiveness, drive, and emotional and social engagement. Persistent negative symptoms are held to account for much of the long-term morbidity and poor functional outcome in patients with established schizophrenia, but if they prove resistant to antipsychotic medication there is a very limited evidence base regarding specific treatments. The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of an SSRI antidepressant, citalopram, in the management of negative symptoms of schizophrenia over a year.

"A Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Paliperidone Extended Release (ER) in the Treatment of Schizophrenia in Adolescent Patients, The study is a multicenter, randomized (treatment group is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the physician nor the patient knows which treatment group the patient is in), parallel-group, placebo controlled study. This study will enroll adolescent men and women who have schizophrenia as specified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; 4th Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of schizophrenia (295.10, 295.20, 295.30, 295.60, and 295.90) as confirmed by the Kiddie-Sads-Present and Lifetime Version (KSADS-PL), and who should have a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score that is between 60 and 120, inclusive, at screening and baseline. Before any study related procedure is performed, the patient and his parent or legal guardian must have provided assent and signed an informed consent form, respectively. The study consists of 3 phases: a screening phase, a 6-week double-blind treatment phase with an end-of-study or early withdrawal visit, and a 1 week follow-up visit for patients who do not enter the optional open-label safety study. In the screening phase, a trained clinician will complete the K SADS-PL interview, including all 5 supplements, to confirm the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia. In addition, the K-SADS-PL screening diagnostic interview items for suicide must each have a score of <=2, as follows: item a), recurrent thoughts of death; item b), suicidal thoughts; item c), suicide attempts and their seriousness; item d), suicide attempts and their lethality; and item e) self harming behavior. Women of childbearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy test at screening, baseline, Week 4, and at end of study or upon early withdrawal from the study. Patients who are receiving prohibited medications, such as antidepressants, lithium, drugs of abuse, and alcohol, will enter a washout period during which medications will be tapered down and eventually stopped. The screening and washout phase may not exceed 21 days. In the double-blind treatment phase, at the baseline visit, the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed. Patients who continue to meet the criteria will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to 1 of 4 dose groups. Patients weighing between 29 to <51 kilograms (kg) will receive paliperidone ER 1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 milligrams (mg) or matching placebo. Patients weighing >=51 kg will receive paliperidone ER 1.5, 6.0, or 12.0 mg or matching placebo. Patients will come to the study site for weekly visits during this phase. A follow-up visit will occur 1 week after the end of treatment for those patients who will not enter the open-label study. Efficacy and safety procedures will be performed at specified times during the study. Efficacy procedures include the administration of the PANSS, Children's Global Assessment (CGAS), Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and a sleep visual analog scale. Safety assessments include a physical examination (ECG measurements, vital signs, weight, height, and waist measurements), clinical laboratory testing, drug screen, Simpson and Angus Scale (SAS), Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Tanner Staging, concomitant medications and the recording of adverse events. A Data Safety Monitoring Board will oversee the conduct of the study and review adverse event reports and laboratory test results. The total volume of blood drawn for laboratory evaluation throughout the study, including 10 milliliters (mL) for the optional pharmacogenomics testing, is approximately 66 mL for each patient.

The primary endpoint for this trial is a composite score derived from the MATRICS cognitive battery. Measures of psychiatric symptoms and functioning are secondary endpoints. Because previous trials in animals and humans with this and other AMPA modulators detected persistence of cognitive benefits, this trial will also repeat clinical assessments at follow-up, four weeks after completion of the study medication.||Primary Objective:||Compare the effects of an eight-week trial of Org 24448 250 mg BID, 500 mg BID and placebo upon cognitive function as assessed by the MATRICS cognitive battery.||Secondary Objectives:||Compare the effects of an eight-week trial of Org 24448 250 mg BID, 500 mg BID and placebo upon level of functioning as measured by the SCoRS and UPSA.|Compare effects of Org 24448 250 mg BID, 500 mg BID and placebo on overall symptoms measured by the BPRS total, psychotic symptoms measured by the BPRS positive symptom items, and negative symptoms measured by the SANS total.||Evaluate tolerability of Org 24448 250 mg BID and 500 mg BID compared to placebo measured by the Side Effect Checklist, AIMS, SAS, study completion rates, and frequency of abnormal laboratory values.||Tertiary Objective:||Evaluate persistence of effects on clinical ratings 4 weeks after completion of the 8-week trial.||Methods:||Study Locations: This study will be coordinated by the study PI, Dr. Goff, and the TURNS Treatment Management Unit under the direction of Dr. Buchanan. Patients will be recruited from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Massachusetts Mental Health Center in Boston (Dr. Goff), the Lemuel Shattuck Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Dr. Seidman), the Nathan Kline Institute (Drs. Javitt and Nolan), Washington University Medical Center (Drs. Csernansky and Barch), the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center (Drs. Buchanan and Gold), Duke School of Medicine (Drs.

The TURNS is a NIMH-funded contract for the evaluation of new compounds for the treatment of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia (HHSN 27820044 1003C; P.I.: Steve Marder, M.D.). Data management will be performed by the Clinical Trials Data Management Unit of the Nathan Kline Institute under the direction of Jim Robinson, M.S., and statistical analysis will be performed by Dr. Robert McMahon of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center. Org 24448 and matching placebo capsules will be provided by Organon Pharmaceuticals. Laboratory assays will be performed by Quest Diagnostics.||Subjects: Subjects will include 135 inpatients or outpatients with schizophrenia treated for at least 8 weeks with a stable dose of an atypical antipsychotic other than clozapine. Prior to enrollment, it will be determined that the clinician has optimized the dose of the antipsychotic and maintained the medication at a constant dose for at least 4 weeks. Diagnoses will be confirmed using the SCID. Patients will be excluded for significant medical illness, seizure disorder, substance abuse, or inability to provide informed consent. Because our primary hypothesis is that Org 24448 will improve measures of attention and memory, patients must be capable of completing the neuropsychological battery, but no minimum threshold of cognitive impairment is required for inclusion.||Screening: The diagnosis of schizophrenia will be confirmed by a research psychiatrist using a modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID). The BPRS, SANS, CDRS and SAS will be administered to verify that inclusionary criteria are met. A physical examination, including neurological exam, will be performed and medical history, vital signs (weight, heart rate, oral temperature, sitting and standing blood pressure), and demographic information will be obtained. Laboratory assessments will include standard screening blood tests: electrolytes, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), fasting glucose, liver enzymes, T4, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, albumin and complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelet count. A pregnancy test will be done in all premenopausal women. A routine urinalysis, drug screen, EKG and EEG with hyperventilation and photic stimulation will also be performed. The screening visits will collect all data required to complete inclusionary and exclusionary criteria except for performance on the MATRICS battery and WTAR, which will be administered as a baseline measurement at week 1 of the stabilization phase to minimize practice effects. In addition, subjects must continue to meet inclusionary and exclusionary criteria on baseline symptom ratings which will be performed at the completion of the stabilization phase (stabilization week 2).||Stabilization Phase: After informed consent is obtained and screening completed, subjects will enter a two-week, single-blind placebo lead-in stabilization phase. Placebo will be administered as two capsules twice daily dispensed in blister packs identical to those that will be used during the randomized, double-blind treatment phase. Baseline assessments will be completed during the stabilization phase and compliance with study medication will be assessed. Plasma will be obtained for assay of antipsychotic concentrations at week 2 of the stabilization phase. The plasma sample will be drawn as a trough level. This phase is intended to reduce placebo-response during the double-blind treatment phase, allow completion of baseline assessments, and provide an opportunity for investigators to identify and resolve potential problems with compliance.||The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR), the Schizophrenia Cognitive Rating Scale (SCoRS), and the University of California San Diego (UCSD) Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA) will be completed at stabilization week 1; the clinical scales (described under ""Assessments"") will be completed at stabilization week 2.||Double-Blind Phase: Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, Org 24448 250 mg BID or Org 24448 500 mg BID administered in identical-appearing capsules for eight weeks. Study drug will be dispensed weekly in blister packs containing placebo or Org 24448 250 mg capsules after completing the stabilization phase (stabilization week 2 and baseline assessments). Subjects will be given three extra days of medication in case of a missed appointment. All subjects will take two capsules twice daily. The antipsychotic dose will be unchanged during the trial. Patients will be asked to bring their previous blister pack to each visit; a count of remaining capsules will be performed and recorded. Patients will return for follow-up at week 12, four weeks after completing the double-blind trial. Investigators may reduce the morning (AM) dose of study drug by one capsule (250 mg) if necessary due to poor tolerance. Subjects may continue at the reduced dose or, after one week, the investigator may attempt to resume the full dose (two capsules BID). If the reduced dose (three capsules daily) is not tolerated, subjects will be discontinued from the study.

"Sensorimotor Gating in Schizophrenia, Patients with schizophrenia have difficulty screening out irrelevant stimuli, and often have the experience of sensory flooding. These ""gating deficits"" may contribute to the thought disorder, cognitive fragmentation and hallucinations which are so debilitating to these individuals. The acoustic startle response is a reflex contraction of the skeletal muscles in response to a sudden acoustic stimulus. It occurs across mammalian species and can be easily measured. The modulation of this reflex by a preliminary nonstartling stimulus is termed prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle (PPI), a paradigm which is used as an operational measure of sensorimotor gating. In consonance with the schizophrenia symptoms that are suggestive of gating deficits, many patients with schizophrenia have deficits in PPI when compared to healthy controls. The brain regions that modulate PPI include the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, areas that are implicated as being abnormal in schizophrenia. Our prior work and work from other labs suggests that PPI impairment in schizophrenia does not improve with treatment and hence may be a trait related abnormality. Work from our current funding period supports our original hypothesis, namely that impaired PPI exhibits familial association. Specifically, we are finding that PPI in first degree family members of subjects with schizophrenia is impaired. Further work is needed in order to establish that PPI impairment is heritable.||An endophenotype is a measurable trait or phenotype detectable by a biological test. Using an endophenotype rather than presence or absence of disease is a powerful tool in the study of diseases with complex polygenic etiologies such as schizophrenia. Progress in the genetics of schizophrenia is greatly confounded by the difficulty in identifying individuals who carry genes contributing to schizophrenia. Incomplete penetrance and the fact that both heritable and environmental factors interact to produce the disease add to this difficulty. This means that some individuals carrying vulnerability genes for schizophrenia who fail to exhibit robust symptoms will be classified erroneously as unaffected in genetic studies, confounding attempts to reliably define the heritable phenotype. The phenomenon of incomplete penetrance is exhibited by the finding that the risk of schizophrenia is the same for children of affected and nonaffected monozygotic twins. The polygenic etiology of schizophrenia makes it unlikely that a pooled sample of individuals defined by the presence of schizophrenia will greatly overlap in the vulnerability genes that they carry. The goal of the endophenotype approach is to narrow the defined phenotype so that a more homogeneous genotype is expected, making it much more fruitful and to conduct genetic studies.||We hypothesize that impaired PPI will prove to be a heritable endophenotype in schizophrenia. Based on our work accomplished during the current funding period, we now propose to further develop this line of research by conducting a heritability analysis of PPI. Our field is greatly in need of this work as a prelude to endophenotype-based genetic studies. We will accomplish our important goal by collecting and characterizing a cohort of healthy controls and their families, and by expanding our sample of schizophrenia subjects and their families. We will collect diagnostic, symptom, cognitive, pedigree, and PPI data all subjects, and will collect blood and extract DNA for future genetic analyses. We will use a family based strategy to investigate the pattern and degree of heritability of impaired PPI in families of schizophrenia and control probands.||This project will provide the necessary next step in advancing the use of impaired PPI as a powerful tool for the discovery of vulnerability genes contributing to schizophrenia. Currently available treatments for this devastating disorder are sadly inadequate. Our medications are virtually ineffective for a subset of our patients. The discovery of vulnerability genes and of a method for biological subtyping of patients will allow our field to develop genetically informed new treatments that specifically target particular subtypes of patients. This approach is our best hope for bringing relief to patients suffering from this disease., Schizophrenia|Prepulse Inhibition|Acoustic Startle",2
"Using Speech to Monitor Symptom Severity in Arabic Speaking Patients With Schizophrenia, Speech disorganization is a key feature of schizophrenia. The development of computerized tools to assess speech disorganization is rapidly growing in schizophrenia research. Several early studies showed that changes in speech distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy controls and assist in differential diagnostics and relapse prevention (1). The Winterlight app can be used for speech collection and assessment and uses speech-based artificial intelligence to identify vocal biomarkers capable of detecting changes in cognitive/clinical symptoms.||Symptom rating scales remain the primary mode of assessing the nature and severity of schizophrenia and the magnitude of any change over time. The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) is a 30-item rating scale that was developed to measure the symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia and assess their dimensions (2). It has been widely used in clinical trials of schizophrenia and is considered as the ""gold standard"" for the assessment of antipsychotic treatment efficacy.||The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that quantitative measures derived from speech samples acquired using the Winterlight application will be associated with positive and negative symptom subscores as assessed by the PANSS.||The investigators will use speech-based artificial intelligence methods to identify aspects of voice and language that are related to schizophrenia symptoms in Arabic-speaking patients.||Data collected may be used to evaluate:||The relationship between speech measures and PANSS subscores at baseline.|The relationship between changes in speech measures and changes in positive symptoms over time.|The relationship between changes in speech measures and changes in negative symptoms over time.|The ability for speech measures to be used to predict psychotic relapse in individuals with schizophrenia.|The feasibility of predicting relapse based on speech and sociodemographic variables., Schizophrenia|Schizophrenic Disorders|Mental Disorders|Speech|Voice|Language|Natural Language Processing|Behavioral Symptoms",2

"Disturbance of Plasma Cytokine Parameters in Clozapine-Resistant Treatment-Refractory Schizophrenia (CTRS) and Their Association With Combination Therapy, Schizophrenia is one of the most serious mental illnesses worldwide that affects approximately 1% of the worldwide population and result in a heavy economic burden to affected family. Antipsychotics are the main stay of treatment of schizophrenia, however, there are still approximately 1/3 schizophrenia patients who does not responded to the antipsychotic agents, and these patients easily develop into treatment-refractory schizophrenia (TRS).||Clozapine is the only evidence based effective medication for treatment-refractory schizophrenia (TRS). In spite of its prominent efficacy, approximately 1/3-2/1 treatment-refractory schizophrenia (TRS) treated with clozapine still present with significant residual psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms. As such, over time, clinicians struggled to find strategies to improve outcome by augmenting the concomitant psychiatric treatments, including not only combining antipsychotics but also combining a mood stabilizer or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).||Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug with multi receptor blocking effect and has a low affinity for dopamine D2. Studies of traditional antipsychotics have suggested that maximal efficacy occurs with dopamine D2 occupancy of 70% or more, while clozapine's dopamine D2 occupancy levels less than 60%. Amisulpride has a highly selective blocking effect on dopamine D2 and dopamine D3 receptors and has no affinity for any other known receptors. Its unique dopamine receptor blocking effect may selectively enhances the limited dopamine D2 blocking effect of clozapine, making it possible to be a suitable and effective drug for combination with clozapine. A number of promising studies that have augmented clozapine with amisulpride, have shown psychiatric symptoms improvement in TRS versus those on clozapine alone.||Both electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and antiepileptic drugs, such as sodium valproate, shares anticonvulsant properties and anticonvulsant effect relate to clinical efficacy. In 1983, Sackeim et al. pointed out that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-induced cortical gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) depletion may be the reason for its anticonvulsant action. In addition, the effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on the gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) system was confirmed by several studies. Interestingly, it has been reported that the therapeutic effect of sodium valproate combined with antipsychotics is closely related to gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) system.||Growing evidence suggests that the immune, endocrine, and nervous systems interact with each other through cytokines, hormones, and neurotransmitters. The activation of the immune system may be involved in the neuropathological changes occurring in the central nervous system. Among several components of immune pathogenesis, aberrant cytokine signaling is considered as one of the key contributors. Many cytokines have been speculated to be involved in the pathological process of schizophrenia. IL-2 acts as a growth factor for T cells, NK cells and B cells, abnormalities of IL-2 serum levels or its production were found in acute schizophrenia cases. IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine, which plays significant role in neurobiological functions like neuronal differentiation and survival, synaptic transmission and brain morphometry. The abnormal expression of IL-6 can be found in both first-episode and chronic schizophrenia. TNF-α is one of the most important pro-inflammatory cytokines, which expressed mainly by macrophages. Previous studies have found that the expression of TNF-α is abnormal in patients with schizophrenia.||The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety between sodium valproate, amisulpride and MECT combination therapy in clozapine-treated refractory schizophrenia during a 12 weeks period. In addition, the effect of combined therapy on plasma cytokines (IL-2, IL-6 and TNF-α) will be evaluated., Schizophrenia， clozapine， amisulpride, valproate， ECT, cytokine",2

"Evaluation of Physical Activity, Physical Fitness, and Quality of Life in Patients With Schizophrenia, Mental health is defined (according to the World Health Organization) as a state of well-being in which a person can realize his/her abilities, coping with the normal stresses of life, and supporting society by working efficiently and productively. In other words, mental health is a dynamic internal balance that enables individuals to use their diversity of skills in harmony with the universal values of the society. For example, it is the flexibility and ability to cope with negative life experiences and social functioning and the harmonious connection between body and mind. To be more concrete, mental health includes different components of life, for example in terms of relationships, good relationships with friends and family, the ability to talk about feelings. Examples of leisure activities include taking up a hobby, exercising regularly, and routinely taking vacations. It is also important to maintain a lifestyle that consists of having a nutritious and regular diet, not smoking and using over-the-counter drugs, and achieving at least some goals in life.||Mental disorders involve a wide variety of problems. Mental disorders are often characterized by a combination of abnormal thoughts, behaviors, emotions, and relationships with other people. Mental disorders include: depression, drug use disorders, mental disabilities, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.||Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder characterized by the appearance of both positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions and negative symptoms such as apathy and withdrawal, repetition of cognitive skills and disorganization. The number of schizophrenic patients in the world is approximately 20 million and this number will continue to increase every year. According to a systematic review of general population studies, the lifetime median prevalence of schizophrenia in Turkey was found to be 8.9 per 1000 people. In addition, schizophrenia patients have irregular self-esteem, inability to maintain social relationships, deterioration in cognitive skills, and sedentary behaviors in their daily lives. Sedentary behavior in patients with schizophrenia will increase the risks of cardiovascular and obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus (especially type 2), cancer that can contribute greatly to death and disability. Therefore, it was found that patients with schizophrenia have a shorter life expectancy of 10-20 years compared to the general population.||It has been found that people with schizophrenia are less physically active and less physically fit than the general population. Physical activity means any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure. Exercise is a subset of physical activity, which is planned, structured and repetitive bodily movements performed to increase and maintain one or more aspects of physical fitness. Physical fitness can be defined as a set of independent qualities associated with the ability to perform physical activities. Components such as cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, muscular endurance and flexibility are more related to health, while components such as coordination and whole-body balance are more related to the performance of physical activities.||There is an inverse relationship between sedentary behavior (related to time spent lying or sitting) and physical activity level in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, physical activity has a direct relationship with physical fitness and physical health in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, one study showed that poor physical activity level and poor physical fitness had a negative effect on the ability of schizophrenia participants to perform activities of daily living performance causes a decrease in the quality of life in these patients. According to the World Health Organization, quality of life is defined as individuals' perceptions of their position in life in the context of the value systems and culture in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns. Quality of life is a subjective, multidimensional term defined as a standard level for physical, emotional, material and social well-being.||Community Mental Health Centers are State institutions that provide treatment and rehabilitation services to patients with certain mental health diseases outside the hospital and within the scope of State Hospitals. Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC) were opened in 2011 by the Ministry of Health in Turkey. Patients diagnosed with serious chronic mental disorders such as depression, drug use-related disorders, mental disabilities, bipolar disorder and especially schizophrenia are treated. The aim of these centers is to improve functional recovery, physical activity level and quality of life and integrate it into daily life, society and business life. It consists of a very comprehensive team of different professionals, such as physicians, psychologists, social workers, and nurses.||Schizophrenic patients are treated in a community mental health center with a comprehensive treatment program. The content of the comprehensive rehabilitation program in community mental health centers includes: Psychosocial skills training / occupational treatments such as painting, music, and also these are done according to the patient's condition / psycho-education for patients and their families (information about the disease and treatment, methods of coping with symptoms are explained) training is provided on issues such as illness, crisis management of patients and their relatives), social skills training (patients who cannot participate in social life due to their illness are given training to gain the ability to reorganize human relations) and group treatment is provided for suitable patients.||Evaluation of physical activity levels, physical fitness, and quality of life of patients with schizophrenia is essential to confirm the effectiveness of treatments and care activities at CMHCs and to plan new therapeutic and rehabilitative activities. In one study, they found that the level of physical activity - physical fitness has a positive effect on psychiatric services and can improve the physical health outcomes of people with schizophrenia. They also reveal improvement in psychological and social outcomes in these patients. Therefore, physical activity level and physical fitness are critical parameters of the biopsychosocial approach in recovery-oriented mental health services. In conclusion, our study aims to decide on physical activity, physical fitness and quality of life levels among a group of patients with schizophrenia treated at CMHC and to evaluate the relationship between these three important treatment parameters.||The aim of this study is to evaluate schizophrenic patients who benefit from community mental health center services in terms of physical activity, physical fitness and quality of life. Therefore, given the importance of our study, our findings may contribute to the literature and improvement for mental health systems for people with psychotic disorders, especially schizophrenia. As a result of this study, an evaluation can be made in terms of physical activity, physical fitness and quality of life in schizophrenic patients who receive service from a community mental health center. According to this study, it will be possible to contribute to the effectiveness of treatments and care activities in CMHCs for patients with schizophrenia., Schizophrenia|Physical Activity|Physical fitness|Quality of life",2
"Translational Investigation of the Glutamatergic and GABAergic System in Schizophrenia, The participant collective will include 3 groups of 200 persons, consisting of patients with schizophrenia, their healthy relatives and healthy controls that are not related to the patients.

"Combination of NMDA-enhancing and Antioxidant Treatments for Schizophrenia, Several lines of evidence suggest that both NMDA and oxidative stress hypotheses have been implicated in schizophrenia. Previous studies found that some NMDA-enhancing agents were able to augment efficacy of antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia. In addition, several drugs with antioxidant properties have been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia too. Whether a drug with antioxidant property can strengthen the efficacy of an NMDA-enhancer (NMDAE) in the treatment of schizophrenia remains unknown. Therefore, this study aims to compare NMDAE plus a drug with antioxidant property and NMDAE plus placebo in the treatment of schizophrenia. The subjects are the schizophrenia patients who remain symptomatic while having been stabilized with antipsychotic treatment. They keep their original treatment and are randomly, double-blindly assigned into two treatment groups for 12 weeks: (1) NMDAE plus Antioxidant agent (AO), or (2) NMDAE plus placebo. Clinical performances and side effects are measured at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12. Cognitive functions are assessed at baseline and at endpoint of treatment by a battery of tests.

"A Study on Etiological Factors of Schizophrenia, Progress Report Schizophrenia is a chronic and devastating major psychiatric disorder. It costs a lot of the individual patient, the family as well as the society. Schizophrenic patients occupy around 80% of the chronic psychiatric beds. About 60 % of the acute psychiatric beds serve the schizophrenic patients at severe aggravating state of illness. The majority of the schizophrenic patients need the support of the family for their daily life. For better service of these patients, their family as well as for reducing social stigma of schizophrenia patients, more psychopathological understanding is crucial. However, schizophrenia is a complex disorder. For the past one century, the understanding of schizophrenia improved much. In Taiwan, the psychopathological study on schizophrenia deserves basic and systematic approach for clinical and academic purpose.||Before it could be possible to understand the essence of the psychopathology of schizophrenia, the descriptive psychopathology has to be well documented. The heterogeneity at the level of clinical pathology has to be delineated as the initial step of psychopathological study of schizophrenia. This is crucial under the consideration of cross-cultural application of diagnostic criteria in the definition of schizophrenia. The psychopathology of the disease category of schizophrenia as defined by the DSM-IV system was documented mainly by the literature based on the descriptive study of the patients of the Caucasian population and the related culture. Western medicine in Taiwan is totally accepted in the academic circle. From a cross-cultural point of view, this way of academic operation has to be reflected methodologically and to be examined empirically.||Research on schizophrenia psychopathology has to be of two kinds of value. The first is to be of the frontier academic work of the World Psychiatry, and the study results can contribute to the knowledge of the World Psychiatry Literature. The second is to be of native cultural value. The results could be of value in reflecting the native cultural reality and could be of value in application of these study results to clinical service.||To be at the frontier of schizophrenia research, the neuropsychological impairments underlined the clinical manifestations of schizophrenia is one major area of study. In contrast to the traditional theory of psychological defense mechanism or the psychosocial explanation of psychopathology of schizophrenia, the neuropsychological approach could provide the way to understand the neural mechanism of schizophrenia psychopathology at the level of psychological function. In the era of neuroscience achievement, this approach is promising and crucial.||The most basic psychopathology of schizophrenia is the genetic factor of etiology. In the era of molecular medicine, the genetic epidemiological and molecular genetic study on schizophrenia psychopathology is the most frontier line of schizophrenia research.||This research team leaded by the Principal Investigator, Hai-Gwo Hwu, of this PPG began this approach in July 1993. The initial work started with the Multidimensional Psychopathological Group Research Project: Schizophrenia"" (MPGRP). This MPGRP was designed based on the theoretical evolutionary model (EM) of psychopathology invented by this Principal Investigator. This EM model included multiple psychopathological factors including genetic factors, brain insults, chronic developmental life experience, neurobiological manifestations, personality-adjustment factor, environmental stress of biological and psychological factors, familial social cultural value factor and the factor of treatment. In this EM model, the disease course was hypothesized into three phases: initial subclinical stage, clinical stage, and the outcome stage after treatment. This MPGRP was thus designed following the guidance of EM psychopathological model.||To design the psychopathological study based on this EM of psychopathology, it is necessary to invent a new methodological approach. This approach included serial multi-dimensional study design. The first step was to set-up a smooth infrastructure and to collect a cohort of clinical schizophrenia cases for follow-up study, and also to collect schizophrenia family with at least two siblings affected with schizophrenia for molecular genetic study. This first step also considered that the descriptive psychopathological study, the study on search for a biological trait marker and the search for identification of linkage of possible vulnerability genetic markers of schizophrenia as the major research tasks.||The initial project started as the MPGRP from July 1993 till June 1998, the subsequent project following the initial MPGRP, was the Multidimensional Psychopathological Study on Schizophrenia (MPSS) started in July 1998 till June 2001. The focus of the MPGRP was to study the clinical manifestations of schizophrenia and the family situation in a cohort of schizophrenia patients. The MPGRP also focused on the phenotype definition of schizophrenia using CPT manifestation in the schizophrenia family. CPT was done in all of the family of schizophrenic patients. The family with at least two siblings affected with schizophrenia were collected for molecular genetic study.||In the MPSS project, the focus was on the follow-up neuropsychological evaluation of the schizophrenia cohort collected in the MPGRP, other than the descriptive follow-up clinical data collection. Besides, the MPSS also focus on the CPT and WCST studies on the family members o the family with at last two siblings affected with schizophrenia. These families are also the sample for molecular genetic study. The collection of the schizophrenia family of this kind for molecular genetic study is still the work of this MPSS, as the collection of this kind of family was not an easy task.||There are several important features characterize the uniqueness of this MPGRP and MPSS : (1) a prospective follow-up design, (2) multidisciplinary approach, (3) multi-center, multi-hospital approach, (4) operationalized assessment of schizophrenia psychopathology using the ""Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale"" (PANSS)(4), (5) covering multi-dimensional psychopathological factors, (6) representing up-to-date psychopathological study of phenotype definition, molecular genetic study, neuropsychological study, as well as the study on the expressed emotion of the chief care giver and the family burden and need of care of the patients.||This MPGRP and the MPSS were successfully carried out from July 1993 to March 2001(up to the time of sending this SEFOS proposal as the subsequent study on the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, a further step of psychopathological study on schizophrenia) based on the following facts:||1. This MPGRP and the MPSS made the multidisciplinary team to be possible in psychopathological study in Taiwan. This is not an easy task. Other than the technological breakthrough in research administration in this manner, the successful element was that this multidisciplinary approach made a smooth working infrastructure for this psychopathological research for successive research works. Other than research work itself, the attending members of this research team obtained continuous training and exercise in psychopathological study. These achievements cannot be demonstrated in literature publication.||2. This MPGRP and the MPSS made the multi-center, multi-hospital approach came true in Taiwan in psychopathological study. This institutional infrastructure guarantee that the sampling of schizophrenic cases to be more representative of patient population for psychopathological study. Other than research administration breakthrough, this approach provided a great chance for clinical psychiatrist to participate in training and practice in psychopathological basic training. Besides, the clinical service team members, other than psychiatrist, including psychiatric nurse, psychologist, psychiatric social worker can obtain the common sense understanding of general psychopathological approach in psychiatry. This close team approach will make the service team to be more cohesive in the care of the patients. The patients attending this study would obtain more attention from the psychiatric service team leaded by the research psychiatrist, especially in the successive follow-up study. This is crucial in elevating the professional activity in a positive sense embedded in this MPGRP and MPSS research. This is also one achievement of this MPGRP and MPSS in the infrastructure of this research approach. These achievements cannot be demonstrated in literature publication, but can be demonstrated in daily research and practice activities. It can also be shown in the subsequent research activities such as this SEFOS project.||3. This MPRP and MPSS brought the Taiwan Psychiatry to the frontier line of psychopathological study and contribute new knowledge to schizophrenia literature. Besides, this MPGRP and MPSS also took care of the standpoint of the native culture background. The descriptive phenomenological approach is the essence of operationalized psychopathological study. The cross-cultural modification and justification of the Western rating schedule of the PANSS has been considered and successfully done.||4. The family of schizophrenic patent was also the major area of study based on the characteristics of the Taiwan culture. The family took the responsibility of patient care closely. The burden and the need of patient care are important topic of this study. Besides, taking the advantage of the culture background of the close family tie of the patient and the family, genetic study of schizophrenia including genetic epidemiology and molecular genetics is one major task of this MGRP and the MPSS too.||5. Major academic achievements of the track of this PPG and the MPSS psychopathological study in these past 7 to 8 years included the following:||The findings of different symptom clusters of schizophrenia:||Categorical or dimensional approach of schizophrenia psychopathology is still a current unsolved issue in schizophrenia research. The MPGRP collected 234 schizophrenia subjects in the Northern part of Taiwan and designed a cohort follow-up study in 1993. At the end of this MPGRP, ranged from1998 to 2000 for data analysis, the descriptive psychopathological PANSS data assessed on admission were analyzed using explorative factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and a basic 4- dimensional model of schizophrenia psychopathology was established. These 4 dimensions are: ""Negative and associated Negative symptoms"", ""Disorganized thought"", ""Hostility/excitement"", and ""Delusion/hallucination"". Including the general psychopathological section of the PANSS, there is an additional dimension of anxiety/depression was found in the EFA. The CFA cannot found satisfactorily model for model fitting as the general psychopathology section was included in CFA. This could be due to the high variability and low base rates of these items of the general psychopathological section of PANSS. Besides, this could also be due to the peripheral nature of these symptom items in schizophrenia psychopathology.||These findings were confirmed by another statistical graphic approach, the color graphic generalized association plots (GAP) in delineating the heterogeneity of descriptive symptom pathology of the schizophrenia. In this GAP analysis, again a 4-dimension model was also found based on the PANSS data assessed on admission. These 4 dimensions were also arranged according to the proximity matrix and were revealed as the following order: (1) ""Negative symptom"", (2) ""Disorganized thought"", (3) ""Hostility/Excitement"". (4) ""Delusion/hallucination"" dimensions. The possible dimension of ""Anxiety/depression"" was also observed near the end of the dimension of ""Negative symptom dimension"".||The validity of these symptom dimensions was assessed using the impairment of sustained attention assessed by continuous performance test (CPT). It was found that the negative symptom dimension was associated with impaired CPT. Furthermore, the severely impaired (Z>3.0) d' of CPT was found to be associated with persistent negative symptom, the deficit state of clinical psychopathology, of schizophrenia. The delusion/hallucination dimension was found to be associated with the impaired neuronal activity of hippocampal region measured by the neuroimaging technology of Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry (MRS).||The GAP analysis based on the successive PANSS data assessed on admission, 6-month, 1-year and 2-year follow-up also showed a stable 5-dimension model of psychopathology. The component symptom dimensions were the same as that of the data assesses on admission. These are dimensions of ""Negative symptom"", ""Disorganized thought"", ""Hostility/excitement"", ""Delusion/hallucination"" and ""Anxiety/depression"". This research team developed the concept of core symptom dimension by selecting the stable symptom items appeared stably over the all follow up course over 4 successive assessments across the 2-year follow-up. The validity of these core psychopathological dimensions composed of core, stable symptom cluster items is still under investigation.||The findings of different subgroups of schizophrenia patients:||Based on the cohort follow-up design, it is possible to search the possibility of the existence of different subgroups of patients be categorical approach. Matched with the effort on differentiating the symptom dimensions of psychopathology, it is also possible to define the different subgroups of patients based on the composition of symptom dimensions. This research team invented this analytical approach called as the GAP analysis for this purpose. The results were partly shown in the website: http://gap.stat.sinica.edu.tw. Based on the admission PANSS data, this GAP found 4 symptom clusters of ""Negative symptom"", ""Disorganized thought"", ""Hostility/excitement"", and ""Delusion/hallucination"", and also two subgroups of patients with (GWNEG) and without (GONEG) marked negative symptoms. These two groups of patients were found to have validity from the manifestation of clinical symptom dimensions in the follow-up course and CPT performance. Besides, these two subgroups also differed in the treatment response an prognostic outcome as shown in social functions.||The GAP analysis, based on the follow-up data of PANSS assessment, can also find consistently a 4 -dimensional model of schizophrenia psychopathology. One additional dimension of anxiety/depression was also found. The patient subgrouping consistently found three patient subgroups at 6-month, 1-year and 2-year follow-up. One is of low psychopathology group (good treatment response group), the other is of marked blunt group and the last is of persistent delusion/hallucination group. The concordance of the GWNEG and GONEG and these three groups are still under investigation.||Impaired sustained attention by continuous performance test (CPT) as the trait marker of schizophrenia.||We used a CPT machine from Sunrise Systems, version 2.20 (Pembroke, MA, USA). The procedure has been described in detail I our publications. Briefly, numbers from 0 to 9 were randomly presented for 50 milliseconds each, at a rate of one per second. Each subject undertook two CPT sessions: the undegraded 1-9 task and the degraded 1-9 task. The sensitivity index (d) of the CPT performance reflects the subject's sustained attention. Family studies have indicated that sustained attention deficits as measured by the CPT are vulnerability markers of schizophrenia. The results are: (1) a substantial proportion of non-psychotic relatives of schizophrenia probands (19-34%) have CPT deficits, which can be predicted from their probands' CPT performance; (2) subjects with schizotypal personality features also exhibit CPT deficits, which are specifically associated with negative factors of schizotypy; (3) CPT deficits are present in schizophrenic patients, are particularly associated with negative and disorganized symptoms, and those with more difficult CPT versions are not amenable to neuroleptic treatment.||The familial tendency of schizophrenia in Taiwan schizophrenia proband In this MPGRP and MPSS stdy, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Genetic Study (DIGS) and schizotypy interview schedule (SIS) were translated and modified to be useful in Taiwan subjects. The Perceptual aberration scale (PAS) and Schizotypal personality questionnaire (SPQ) were also used in community study on schizophrenia-related personality disorders. The cross-cultural consideration was employed. In community study, the schizophrenia-related personality disorders were assessed using the PAS and SPQ initially and then by DIGS and SIS interview. Including schizophrenia-related personality disorder in the spectrum did not increase power for linkage analysis o schizophrenia. This is one important information for our molecular genetic study of this MPGRP and MPSS.||Explorative neurobiological study on the schizophrenic samples of this MPGRP and the MPSS project.||The neuropsychological study of the MPSS design and the impact of the concept of endophenotype of molecular genetic study induce this MPSS research team to explore the role of the neurophysiological parameter of P50 inhibition and the neurochemical parameter of neuronal activity shown in Magnetic Resonance Imaging Spectrometry (MRS) of relative concentrations of various specific biochemical molecules such as choline and creatinine.||The P50 study and the related neurophysiological study provided the chance to study the implicit and explicit study paradigm of schizophrenia. The implicit learning of color in schizophrenia was fond to be significantly impaired as compared to the controls. The 3-D dimension display of brain energy in this P50 study showed that the energy distribution of the schizophrenic patients was significantly different from that of the controls. The MRS study showed that the positive symptom cluster was correlated to the decreased neuronal activity of the hippocampal region. These study results make it possible for this research tem to design the research on the all family members of the schizophrenia proband for pathogenesis genetic study on multi-etiological factors and their interaction by using these neurobiological parameters designed in this SEFOS, an investigation on the dynamic pathogenetic process of schizophrenia, leaded by this Principal Investigator with smooth working infrastructure for multidimensional psychopathological study on schizophrenia.||Molecular genetic study on locating vulnerability gene in different chromosome regions.||Linkage study and association study were performed in this project for locating the vulnerability genes of schizophrenia by examining the warm spots of schizophrenia in some chromosome regions of chromosome 1q, 6p, 8p, and 15q. The study results, so far obtained in this laboratory using 52 Taiwanese families with at least 2 siblings affected with schizophrenia, could not exclude the possible existence of the schizophrenia vulnerability genes locations in these chromosome regions.||Further study of the PPG of SEFOS will focus on these positions of these 5 markers with potential linkage to find closer genetic markers possibly linked with schizophrenia using closer genetic markers such as the combination of dinucleotide and SNP markers. The candidate genes around these genetic markers will also be explored to search for mutations related to the pathological variation of schizophrenia. This will be the focus of this PPG of SEFOS too following this MPGRP and MPSS.||This laboratory is exploring for the possibility of the candidate gene approach based on plausible animal model of schizophrenia and/or pathophysiological process of schizophrenia. The NMDA subunit R1 receptor gene and nicotinic receptor alpha 7 subtype genes are two genes under exploration. The skin test of niacin test was also explored in this laboratory for the possible association with genetic defect in the phospholipid metabolism related genes. These will be included in this PPG of SEFOS study in the future.||Expressed emotion and burden of the family of schizophrenic patients The family as a unit of study is also concerned in this MPGRP and the MPSS. The expressed emotion was once considered to be a stable trait of the family chief caregiver and was hypothesized to have specific psychopathological meaning in schizophrenia. However, the expressed emotion of the Taiwanese schizophrenia family was found to be changing according the course of illness. It was not stable. The family burden was found to be very high and specific clinical measures for relieving thee family burden has to be designed for better clinical service of the schizophrenia family.|Invention of statistical method for psychopathological study The multivariate nature of the psychopathological data demands the invention of novel statistical method for data management. In this MPGRP and the MPSS, the analysis of 33 PANSS symptoms and the subgrouping of the patients in the study of schizophrenia heterogeneity invite a development of the new color graphic approach in the exploration of symptom dimensions and patent subgrouping. This was named as Generalized Association Plots (GAP). This demonstrates the fruitful approach in the multi-disciplinary team-work in the psychopathological study.|Data bank establishment of this MPGRP and the MPSS. In the past 7 to 8 years of the MPGRP and MPSS work, important data banks of clinical psychopathology of schizophrenia were established. These data banks will be useful for successive data analysis to test the various hypotheses related to the issues of heterogeneity of schizophrenia. These data banks included (1) basic clinical data bank of schizophrenia cohort of 234 cases and their follow-up clinical data for up to 7 years of follow-up data, (2) data bank of objective ratings of PANSS, ESRS, and CDRS, and (3) neuropsychological testing data bank of successive follow-up neuropsychological evaluations. The DNA bank and cell-line bank of the families of schizophrenia and other related disorders is also very important for further molecular genetic evaluation.||Other than this DNA data bank of this MPGRP and MPSS, this laboratory also performed the Taiwan Schizophrenia Linkage Study (TSLS) in collaboration with researchers of the Harvard Medical School under the support of the NIMH, U.S.A., to collect 600 families with at least two siblings affected with schizophrenia. This data bank included DIGS, DNA and CPT as well as WCST. This research team will use this data set to replicate the initial findings obtained in this laboratory originally. This will be one major focus of the subsequent SEFOS of this PPG.||All these data banks justify the abundant resource of data for continuous data analysis and paper publication of this SEFOS of the PPG, and this is the reason that this SEFOS has to set the core containing a statistical sub-core unit for the operation of data analysis. Up to the present, this research team is mature enough to do continuous data analysis and serial hypothesis testing. All these data provided the evidence that the grant of this SEFOS will, apparently, achieve the expected results of this research team with great confidence.||6. The progress of the MPSS (July, 1998 - June 2001) till March, 2001 as the PPG of SEFOS was proposed. Three sub-projects were reported to be as the following:||1) Phenomenological and neuropsychological manifestations of schizophrenia: a prospective follow-up study.||(2) A family-genetic study of co-affected sib-pairs with schizophrenia. (3) Molecular genetic study on schizophrenia using co-affected sib-pair and association strategies.||In conclusion, this MPSS has been going on smoothly in data collection as well as in data analysis. The paper publication is going on steadily. These three sub-projects were integrated and coordinated smoothly. Besides, the preliminary works using the neurobiological technology of neurophysiology and brain Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry (MRS) for measurements of psychopathological related manifestations have been performed. These technologies were proved to be satisfactorily stable and applicable in psychopathological study. The preliminary results were obtained and manuscripts were prepared for submission. Actually, the technology can also be extended to the other brain parts including the frontal region and the measurement of tractography is also available in the imaging laboratory of the National Taiwan University Hospital.||The past tract record of the achievement of the smooth working infrastructure of this research team leaded by the P.I. Hai-Gwo Hwu, including multidisciplinary specialists and multi-institutes, the achievement of the advanced technologies of neurobiological measurements related to the study of current psychopathological investigation of schizophrenia, the previous achievement in psychopathological hypothesis testing and the academic achievement of this research team, and the abundant data bank, highly justify that this research team of the SEFOS of this PPG is a well cultivated research tem in schizophrenia research. This SEFOS of PPG can positively be expected to have successful results in the future if this team has this SEFOS grant for the coming 5 years of research work., Schizophrenia",2
"Validation of a Clinical Screening Grid for Syndromic Schizophrenia, Methods: This study aims to validate a short clinical screening grid for syndromic forms of schizophrenia linked to a pathogenic Copy Variation Number (CNV). The investigators plan to include 150 patients with defined (DSM V) schizophrenia and aged 15 years and more. The clinical grid will be prospectively fulfilled for every patients on the basis of his/her medical history and clinical examination. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH-a) will be performed on jugal mucosae sample to detect precisely syndromic forms of schizophrenia linked to the presence of a pathogenic Copy Number Variation (CNV).||In subjects with no CNV that may explain the onset of schizophrenia, the investigators would like to complete the investigations with exome trio sequencing. With this type of very clinical approach, the investigators wish to determine which semiological elements should alert the psychiatrists as to the presence of a syndromic form. The objective is to propose at the end of this study a simple and reliable scale, usable in psychiatry consultation, to guide the genetic screening of forms of syndromic schizophrenia., 0",2
"A Study of Risperidone Long-Acting Injection Versus Oral Antipsychotics in Schizophrenia Participants With a History of Being Poorly Compliant With Taking Their Medication, This is a Phase 4, an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-country and multi-centric (conducted in more than one center) study of risperidone long-acting formulation versus oral (having to do with the mouth) atypical antipsychotics in participants with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Text revision ( DSM-IV TR) diagnosis of schizophrenia currently being treated with oral antipsychotic medication. The duration of this study will be 2 years. All the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to an oral atypical antipsychotic (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and where commercially available, aripiprazole and amisulpride) or to risperidone long-acting formulation. For risperidone long-acting formulation participants, study medication will be administered by intramuscular (into the muscle) injection every 2 weeks at doses of 25, 37.5 or 50 milligram (mg). Oral supplementation with the current oral atypical antipsychotic is required for the first 3 weeks following the initial injection and dose increase. Dose increase can be made as per product labeling. The primary measure of effectiveness is the reduction in the percentage of participants experiencing a clinical exacerbation after being in the study for 3 months. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study., Schizophrenia|Risperidone|Risperdal Consta",2

"A Multicenter Study of NAP (AL-108) in Schizophrenia, Background||AL-108 is an intranasal drug product containing NAP, an 8 amino-acid peptide (Asn-Ala-Pro-Val-Ser-Ile-Pro-Gln; NAPVSIPQ, MW=824.9) fragment of the much larger (approx. 124KD) Activity-Dependent Neuroprotective Protein (ADNP), which participates in neurodevelopment and neuroprotection. In mice, ADNP knockouts are lethal exhibiting CNS dysgenesis. ADNP mediates its effects in part through interaction with microtubules. Because of its large size, ADNP is assumed to not penetrate the BBB and thus cannot be used pharmacologically. NAP was chosen because it represents the epitope most associated with microtubule interaction and neuroprotection. NAP is absorbed following IV or intranasal administration, and has been shown to cross the BBB.||Rationale for NAP treatment: tubulin function in brain function||The cytoskeleton plays a key role in maintaining the highly asymmetrical shape and structural polarity of neurons that are essential for neuronal physiology. The cytoskeleton is made up of microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules. Microfilaments (4-9 nm diameter) are made up of actin monomers and they function mainly to provide mechanical support and locomotion to the cell. Intermediate filaments are cytoplasmic fibers of ~10nm diameter. They provide supporting framework within the cell. Microtubules (~24nm diameter) consist of tubulin and microtubule associate proteins. They function to transport nutrients and chemical messengers along the cell. Neurofibrillary tangles are twisted bundles of neurofibrils formed when the microtubule-associated protein, tau, dissociates from microtubules and clusters to form an insoluble mass. Under normal conditions tau binds to microtubules, stabilizing neuronal structure and integrity.||Hyperphosphorylation of tau is assumed to be the cause for the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Although neurofibrillary tangles are most associated with cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimers disease, some increase in neurofibrillary pathology has also been reported in schizophrenia, potentially as consequence of antipsychotic medication (1). Thus, mechanisms underlying microtubular function may be relevant to schizophrenia as well. In association with tubulin polymerization into microtubules, NAP influences tau dynamics by increasing the ratio of non-phosphorylated tau to phosphorylated tau, implying a dynamic process of cellular maintenance of the microtubular network, which is essential for the survival of the cell.||In brain, tubulin frameworks are stabilized by recently described STOP proteins (2) (aka MAP6). Linkages to allelic variation in STOP genes has been reported in schizophrenia, along with altered STOP protein expression in some brain regions (3). STOP knockdown mice show disturbances in dopaminergic neurotransmission (4) along with deficits in PPI and hypermotility that were partially reversed with clozapine (5). Thus, neuropathological features of schizophrenia may be due, in part, to abnormal STOP-related stabilization of microtubular structure, and NAP may stabilize STOP-related abnormal neurophysiological processes in schizophrenia., Cognition|Schizophrenia",2

"A Safety, Tolerability, and Treatment Response Study of Paliperidone Palmitate Administered to Patients With Schizophrenia, This study is an 18-month, single-group, open-label (name of study drug is known to patients), multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and treatment response of paliperidone palmitate administered as once-monthly injections to patients with schizophrenia who previously received treatment with oral antipsychotic medications. A target of 587 patients (inpatients or outpatients) with schizophrenia will be enrolled in the study and will receive, without cost, injections of study drug (paliperidone palmitate) on Days 1, 8, 38, and thereafter at one-month intervals up to 18 months. Enrollment in the study will be limited to patients who are diagnosed with schizophrenia within the past 5 years. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 5 days before treatment, an 18-month treatment period, and an end-of-study or early withdrawal visit approximately 30 days after the last injection of study drug. During the screening period (after patients have provided signed informed consent to participate in the study), information will be collected regarding the patients medical and psychiatric history, demographics (age and race), current symptoms of the patients schizophrenia, and whether or not the patient would like to sign an additional informed consent form to participate in the pharmacogenomic (the study of how genes affect a person's response to drugs) component of the study that involves the collection of one 10 ml blood sample (equivalent to about 2 teaspoons of blood). During screening, entry criteria for the study will be reviewed and a physical examination performed. Patients will also be asked questions about the types of healthcare resources (institutionalizations/hospitalizations, emergency room visits, etc) they utilized during the previous 12 months however, this information is optional and its collection will depend upon the availability of the data. Patients who are currently receiving treatment with any oral antipsychotic medication must discontinue the use of the medication by Day 1 of the study. If the patient was receiving a high dose of an antipsychotic medication or was also receiving an anticholinergic medication (a drug that prevents involuntary muscle movements associated with the use of antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia), the investigator may decide to have the patients dose of antipsychotic (and/or anticholinergic) medication tapered (gradually reduced) to discontinuation beginning on Day 1. The patients time to taper-off the previous antipsychotic and/or anticholinergic medications will depend on the dose of the medication. Patients receiving anxiolytics (anti-anxiety drugs), mood stabilizers, anticholinergics, or antidepressants greater than 4 weeks before the screening visit will be allowed to continue taking these drugs. Upon meeting the entry criteria for the study, patients will receive a total of 19 intramuscular (IM) injections of paliperidone palmitate during the 18-month treatment period as follows: 150 mg equivalent (eq) on Day 1, 100 mg eq on Day 8, 75 mg eq on Day 38, and paliperidone palmitate injections of 50, 75, 100, or 150 mg eq once monthly on Days 68, 98, 128, 158, 188, 218, 248, 278, 308, 338, 368, 398, 428, 458, 488 and 518. Depending on the patients ability to tolerate a dose paliperidone palmitate, doses may be adjusted higher or lower every 30 days per the clinicians judgment within the dose range of 50 to 150 mg eq. If the patient reports any signs or symptoms of worsening of schizophrenia, the investigator may prescribe a rescue medication (quick-relief or fast-acting medications that usually work right away to relieve symptoms) such as lorazepam (an antianxiety drug) to control agitation, irritability, restlessness, and hostility. The investigator may also prescribe an anticholinergic medication to treat involuntary movement disorders if observed in patients. All prescription and over-the-counter medications taken by patients during the study are to be reported. At the end of the 18-month treatment period, all patients will complete an end-of-study visit (or early withdrawal visit for patients who do not complete the study) to have a physical examination performed, laboratory tests (including a urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential) performed, vital signs measured, and information collected regarding the occurrence of adverse events and the use of medications other than study drug from the time of the previous study visit to the end-of-study (or early withdrawal visit). The primary objective of the study is to evaluate safety, tolerability and treatment response of once-monthly injections of paliperidone palmitate measured by the use of a Positive And Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). The safety and tolerability of once-monthly injections of paliperidone palmitate administered to patients with schizophrenia will be evaluated during the study by monitoring adverse events, findings from clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry including lipids), vital sign measurements (blood pressure, pulse rate, and weight), physical examinations, and movement disorder evaluations using the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale [ESRS-A]). All clinically significant abnormalities in patients that persist at the end of the study will be followed by the Investigator until resolution or until a clinically stable endpoint is reached. Treatment response will be evaluated 5 times during the study (Visits 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10) by findings obtained from the PANSS (a 30-item questionnaire that is administered to the patient by a qualified person [ie, rater] to measure the presence/absence and severity of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition to the safety, tolerability, and treatment response data collected, patients who volunteer to participate in the pharmacogenomic component of the study will have one 10 ml sample of blood collected at on Days of Visit 2. If a replacement blood sample is needed for the pharmacogenomic component of the study, the patient will need to sign an additional informed consent form. Patients will receive a paliperidone palmitate intramuscular (IM) injection of 150 mg equivalent (eq) on Day 1, 100 mg eq on Day 8, and 75 mg eq on Day 38.Thereafter, patients will receive once monthly IM injections of 50, 75, 100, or 150 mg eq of paliperidone palmitate. Doses may be adjusted every 30 days per the clinician's judgment within the dose range of 50 to 150 mg eq.Patients will receive a total of 19 injections of study drug over an 18-month treatment period., Schizophrenia|R092670|Paliperidone palmitate|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition|Intramuscular injection",2
"Combination of NMDA-enhancing and Anti-inflammatory Treatments for Ultra-resistant Schizophrenia, Several lines of evidence suggest that both NMDA and inflammatory hypotheses have been implicated in schizophrenia. Previous study found that some NMDA-enhancing agent was able to augment efficacy of clozapine for clinical symptoms but not cognitive function in the treatment of ultra-resistant schizophrenia. In addition, several drugs with anti-inflammatory properties have been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia. Whether a drug with anti-inflammatory property can strengthen the efficacy of an NMDA-enhancer (NMDAE) in the treatment of ultra-resistant schizophrenia remains unknown.||Therefore, this study aims to compare NMDAE plus a drug with anti-inflammatory property and NMDAE plus placebo in the treatment of ultra-resistant schizophrenia. The subjects are the patients with ultra-resistant schizophrenia who have responded poorly to clozapine treatment. They keep their original clozapine treatment and are randomly, double-blindly assigned into two treatment groups for 12 weeks: (1) NMDAE plus Anti-inflammatory Agent (AIFA), or (2) NMDAE plus placebo. Cognitive functions are assessed at baseline and at endpoint of treatment by a battery of tests. Clinical performances and side effects are measured at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12. The efficacies of NMDAE plus AIFA and NMDAE plus placebo will be compared.||Chi-square (or Fisher's exact test) will be used to compare differences of categorical variables and t-test (or Mann-Whitney test if the distribution is not normal) for continuous variables between treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline in repeated-measure assessments will be assessed using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) for both primary and secondary outcomes .

"Safety, Efficacy and Tolerability Study of Paliperidone Extended-Release (ER) in Participants With Schizophrenia, This is a single arm (one group of participants), multi-center, 6-month study to explore the tolerability, safety and efficacy of flexibly dosed paliperidone ER in participants with schizophrenia previously unsuccessfully treated with an oral antipsychotic medication. Antipsychotic medications are drugs that are helpful in the treatment of psychosis and have a capacity to ameliorate thought disorders. Unsuccessfully treated means that, despite the participant was treated with an adequate dose of an appropriate oral antipsychotic for an adequate period of time, previous treatment is considered unsuccessful due to lack of efficacy, lack of tolerability or safety, lack of compliance and/or other reasons. Throughout the study the investigators will adjust the dosage of each participant based on the individual needs. In general, the recommended paliperidone ER dose will be 6 milligram once daily. Participants can be either in- or outpatients and they may take their study drug with or without food. Participants who will complete this 6-month study and would like to continue will be eligible to be enrolled in an extension phase until paliperidone ER is available., Schizophrenia|Paliperidone|Paliperidone extended-release (ER)",2
"Tryptophan MRI in People With Schizophrenia and Healthy Controls, There is emerging evidence to suggest that disturbances in the kynurenine pathway may be related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Several post-mortem studies have documented specific abnormalities in the kynurenine pathway, including increased levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid (KYNA) in the prefrontal cortex of people with schizophrenia (1-4). Increased levels of kynurenine and KYNA have also been observed in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of people with this illness (5). In addition, post-mortem studies have documented changes in key enzymes, including increased expression of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (2, 6) (TDO), which converts tryptophan to kynurenine, and reduced activity of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) (4), which may shift metabolism towards enhanced KYNA formation. Finally, a number of genetic studies have implicated the KYNA pathway in this disease. Wonodi et al. (7) found decreased KMO gene expression in the frontal eye field of people with schizophrenia, and Holtze et al. (8) recently reported an association between a KMO SNP and CSF levels of KYNA. Notably, although the exact mechanism underlying the KP impairment in people with schizophrenia is unknown, immune and stress mechanisms have been implicated (7,9).||Increased KYNA may have a number of adverse consequences of importance in schizophrenia. In particular, KYNA is an antagonist of the α7 nicotinic and NMDA glutamate receptors. Dysfunctions of these receptors have been linked to the cognitive impairments and symptom manifestations observed in people with schizophrenia. The purpose of the proposed project is to examine the impact of increased brain KYNA on performance of cognitive tasks and related neuroimaging measures in people with DSM-5/DSM-IV-TR schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or schizoaffective disorder patients and healthy controls. In addition, the investigators will secondarily investigate the relationship of peripheral inflammatory markers and glucocorticoid levels as part of the HPA stress axis to examine relationships and shift to a Type 2 immune response in schizophrenia. Using tryptophan loading to increase KYNA levels, the study will test the hypothesis, based on complementary preliminary studies in rodents, that disease-related cognitive deficits in people with schizophrenia are preferentially susceptible to (further) elevations in KYNA levels.||The investigators hypothesize that tryptophan-induced elevations in brain KYNA levels will: 1) acutely impair performance on measures of verbal and visual memory, attention, working memory, and processing speed in people with schizophrenia; 2) alter dorsolateral-hippocampal activation and connectivity, which underlies the performance of the relational memory task; and 3) decrease mPFC MRS measures of glutamate, consistent with preclinical microdialysis data. In an exploratory framework, the investigators hypothesize that increased brain KYNA levels alter default network activation and connectivity, an effect which may be mediated by the action of KYNA on α7 nicotinic and/or NMDA receptors. The investigators will also investigate the extent to which cytokine and HPA axis peripheral measures are related to the effect of tryptophan-induced elevated KYNA levels on cognitive performance and fMRI and MRS measures. Comparisons with results from healthy controls will determine if participants with schizophrenia have an aberrant or exaggerated response to increased KYNA levels.||Funding Information:||Funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)||Grant Number- 1P50MH103222-01||Principal Investigator- Robert Schwarcz, PhD||Project Title- Kynurenic Acid and Cognitive Abnormalities in Schizophrenia||Program Officer Full Name- Steven Zalcamn||External Org# Name- University of Maryland, Baltimore, tryptophan|kynurenic acid|schizophrenia",2

"Safety and Effectiveness of D-serine in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a life-long brain disorder affecting approximately 1 percent of Americans each year. Schizophrenia can be extremely disabling, causing people to hear voices, experience paranoia or hallucinations, believe that others are controlling their thoughts, and even fail at maintaining a job or caring for themselves. Current medications help to relieve most of these symptoms, but not all. Some people with schizophrenia still suffer from negative symptoms, such as difficulty with talking, expressing emotions, and motivation; they may also suffer from cognitive impairments, such as decreased concentration and memory loss. D-serine, an amino acid found within the body, activates brain cell receptors that appear to play a role in learning and memory. This study will determine whether adding a D-serine solution to a stable antipsychotic medication regimen will decrease negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia.||Participants in this open-label study will remain on their regular medication regimen for at least 2 weeks. During this time and before starting treatment, participants will be interviewed about their emotional problems, marital status, education, family background, employment history, and any drug or alcohol problems. Participants will also undergo a physical exam, an electrocardiogram (EKG), vital sign measurements, psychological tests, cognitive tasks, and an electroencephalogram (EEG). Participants will then begin 4 weeks of treatment with D-serine. In addition to participants' regular medication regimen, they will drink a D-serine powder mixed with water twice daily. Every 2 weeks, participants will undergo a physical exam and an interview about any changes in symptoms or emotional problems that they may be experiencing. Blood and urine samples will be taken throughout the study. After 4 weeks, participants will undergo an EKG, EEG, and the same psychological tests and cognitive tasks completed prior to treatment.

"Cognitive Remediation Program for Family Caregivers in Schizophrenia, Context and justification It has been shown that when patient's family commits to a psycho-educational programme, the relapse rate of the patients themselves is halved to an equivalent level to that of drug treatment. Cognitive disorders affect 80% of patients with schizophrenia and have deleterious consequences on their autonomy and daily functioning. Cognitive remediation has now clearly demonstrated its effectiveness in the management of these cognitive disorders, particularly with regard to compensatory approaches that aim modifying the environment and providing external support. However, access to cognitive remediation remains extremely limited. It is only available in a limited number of specialized centres. In order to allow a better access to these cognitive remediation methods and to maintain its effects over time, the objective of this research project is to develop a web-based intervention, the Cognitive Adaptative Training for Caregivers (""CAT famille""), aimed at accompanying and guiding family carers via an internet video chat with a psychologist to implement cognitive remediation techniques of compensatory approach directly into their sick relative living home.||Main and secondary objectives The main objective is to evaluate the impact of a web-based intervention aimed at training a family caregiver in cognitive remediation techniques using a compensatory approach on the daily life functioning of his/her family member suffering from schizophrenia. Secondary objectives are to assess improvement in: 1) caregiver burden, 2) caregiver and patient quality of life, 3) negative symptoms, and 4) patient compliance.||Methodology This is a comparative, prospective, randomized study including two groups of (patient/caregiver) dyads: 1) an intervention group consisting of a (patient + family carer) dyad benefiting, in addition to the usual treatment, from the intervention for the family carer, and 2) a group consisting of a (patient + caregiver) dyad with usual care (control group).||Control group: Psycho-education manual, with a weekly reading module and a 15-minute webcam feedback by the psychologist.||Intervention group: Family CAT manual, with a module each week to be read according to the patient's objectives and a 15-minute webcam feedback by the psychologist.||For all groups:||Before intervention: Neuropsychological assessment + home assessment of the environment and the performance of daily living activities by psychologist A.||After intervention: Home assessment of the environment and the performance of daily living activities by psychologist B.||The inclusion criteria are: 1) for patients: patients with schizophrenia, aged 18 to 50, who can read, understand and speak French, 2) for parents: understand, speak and read French. The main outcome will be the assessment of the patient's daily life functioning as measured by the Life Skills Profile.||Process:||Total number of visits and follow-up: 3 visits during a prospective follow-up over 10 months Duration of inclusions: 18 months and duration of statistical analysis/valuation: 3-6 months||Feasibility:||The University Service of Adult Psychiatry of the University Hospital of Montpellier is one of the schizophrenia expert centres of the Fondamental network.

"The Mid-term Effect of Repeated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Schizophrenia, Medications have a poor effect on negative symptoms and cognitive function in schizophrenia. In the past, most of the studies on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation intervention in patients with schizophrenia used conventional stimulation sites and patterns, and the intervention effect was still controversial. A few studies have achieved positive results with the new stimulation model (TBS model) and the therapeutic target (cerebellar vermis), but the follow-up period did not exceed 2 weeks, and no similar studies have emerged in China.

"A Neurofeedback Intervention to Improve Working Memory in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a chronic debilitating mental disorder that affects 2.4 million Americans and leads to considerable individual and societal costs. In patients with SCZ, cognitive deficits (CD) occur early in the course of the illness, are associated with more severe illness, and are the best predictor of functional outcomes. Nonetheless, to date, CD have been difficult to treat using available treatments. Recent studies suggest CD in patients with SCZ may arise from abnormal synchronization of distributed neural networks. Synchronization or synchronous firing of neurons, binds cortical areas into functional networks in a task and state-dependent manner. Thus novel therapies that improve abnormal neural synchrony may improve previously refractory symptoms arising from disordered brain networks.||Neural synchrony or coherence in the gamma band (GBR, 30-45Hz) plays a central role in top-down attention, multisensory processing, perceptual binding and working memory (WM). Patients with SCZ exhibit abnormal GBR, and the magnitude of impairment is associated with the severity of cognitive disorganization. Given these results, improving GBR should improve CD, including WM in SCZ. This hypothesis has been tested and confirmed using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Additionally, EEG-based neurofeedback (NFB) is hypothesized to improve GBR and cognitive function in patients with SCZ. NFB is a low-cost, easily administered and well-tolerated treatment. In healthy controls, Gamma-NFB improves GBR and cognitive function including WM. Thus, the investigators propose testing the feasibility and effectiveness of improving GBR using gamma-NFB in patients with SCZ using the framework of the R61/R33 mechanism.||The first trial (R61) is a proof-of-concept study designed to assess target engagement and dose response curve. Thirty SCZ patients will receive G-NFB training for 12 weeks (2 weekly sessions of 30minute duration) and be assessed for 1) evidence of training, 2) Change in GBR, 3) Change in WM and 4) Change in community functioning. The second trial (R33) aims to confirm target engagement based on training parameters obtained from R61, and to assess whether G-NFB is superior to an active-placebo neurofeedback intervention in improving GBR, WM and community functioning., Neurofeedback, Gamma band response",2
"Mindfulness-based Illness Management Program for Schizophrenia, Objectives: This study is to test the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based illness management program for Chinese outpatients with schizophrenia over a 24-month follow-up. The program is an integrated, insight-inducing educational program that addresses patients' awareness and knowledge of schizophrenia and skills of illness management.||Methods: A two-phase, single-blind, multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 449 Chinese patients with schizophrenia in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan. In the first phase, 107 participants will be randomly selected from the eligible patient lists of three outpatient clinics in Hong Kong only (i.e., 38 subjects from each clinic), and after baseline measurement, be assigned to either the mindfulness-based illness management program, conventional psycho-education group, or usual psychiatric care. For the second phase, the participants will be randomly selected from the eligible patient list in three study venues or countries (i.e., 114 subjects from each study site/ country) and after baseline measurement, be assigned similar to the first phase to one of the three study groups. The patients' mental and psychosocial functioning, insights into illness, and their re-hospitalization rates will be measured at recruitment and at one week, and 6, 12 and 24 months after completing the interventions.||Hypothesis: The patients in the mindfulness-based psycho-education program will report significantly greater improvements in their symptoms and re-hospitalization rates (primary outcomes) and other secondary outcomes (e.g., insight into illness and functioning) over the 24-month follow-up, when compared with those in psycho-education group or usual care.||Conclusions: The findings will provide evidence whether the mindfulness-based psycho-education program can better improve Chinese schizophrenia sufferers' psychosocial functioning and reduce their illness relapse., mindfulness-based program|Psychoeducation|schizophrenia|Chinese|outpatients",2

"Is MS14 Helpful in Schizophrenia?, Schizophrenia is a chronic illness characterized by disturbances in cognition, affect and behavior, all of which have a bizarre aspect. It is a common disorder, with a prevalence of about 1%. It has an equal prevalence in both sexes although men manifest their symptoms earlier than women. [1, 2] Individuals with schizophrenia have a 2-3 fold increase in mortality rate compared to the general population. This rate had increased in recent decades. [3, 4] Most patients are incapable of maintaining their jobs and relationships. About half attempt suicide, and about 10% succeed. Most suicides occur early in the course of the illness. [1] Optimal management of schizophrenia requires psychological, social, and occupational therapies. [2] There are a lot of antipsychotic drugs which are necessary for treatment. Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of schizophrenia in the adolescent population in the adolescent population. [5] Although atypical antipsychotic agents have improved outcomes in schizophrenia, their clinical potential remains limited by patients' nonadherence to medication. [6] Some of the patients with schizophrenia do not respond completely to treatment and only experience a partial improvement and remain functionally impaired. While medication has been found to be effective for the treatment of ""positive"" symptoms of the disease, treatment of the ""negative symptoms"" of schizophrenia (including lack of energy, motivation, and emotions) has historically not been very successful. [4, 5] MS14 is an Iranian herbal-marine compound that has been patented by invention and patent registration office of Islamic Republic of Iran (no: 29350) and classified as equivalent to food with no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL). [8, 9] According to analytic data this compound contains many inorganic salts or complexes and also trace elements such as bromine (Br), strontium (Sr), vanadium (V), titanium (Ti), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn). [10] Safety of MS14 has been confirmed by sub-acute toxicity studies in rats (clinical, histopathological, hematological and biochemical). [8] A study of MS14 in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) model has shown that oral treatment of the EAE mice with MS14 not only halts the progression of the disease but also attenuates the inflammation in CNS indicating that this herbal-marine compound has anti-inflammatory effects [11].||Overall, alleviation of clinical and neurological symptoms in EAE mice by MS14 explained the beneficial effects of traditionally used MS14 in MS patients, an effect which could also be investigated in other groups of psychological and neurological diseases. Additionally, there are anecdotal but unconfirmed reports for the effectiveness of MS14 in patients with schizophrenia. In this regard, we have decided to perform a randomized placebo-controlled study on the effect of MS14 on schizophrenia, to assess the safety and efficacy of this compound., Schizophrenia treatment MS14 randomized clinical trial",2

"Study to Measure Drug Satisfaction of Patients With Schizophrenia After Switching From Risperidone to Paliperidone, Paliperidone ER has been shown to be effective compared to placebo (""a sugar pill"") in the acute treatment and maintenance of patients with schizophrenia. Paliperidone ER combines an active metabolite of another antipsychotic, risperidone, with manufacturing technology allowing more gradual release of the drug and less difference in high and low blood levels of the drug. Side effects to medications are sometimes due to wide differences in these high and low blood levels. Recent research has shown that many patients with schizophrenia discontinue their antipsychotic medication due to ""subject-choice"". Therefore, it is important that research studies attempt to measure patients' satisfaction with antipsychotic medication, in addition to measuring how they respond on tests of effectiveness. This study has been designed to evaluate antipsychotic medication satisfaction in patients who continue to have symptoms of schizophrenia, and who say they are dissatisfied with their current risperidone treatment. The primary outcome is the change in the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) score, from baseline to the Week 6 endpoint. These patients are randomized (like flipping a coin) as to when their risperidone (4 mg to 6 mg per day) is switched to paliperidone ER. Because the study is 'blinded', neither the study doctor nor the patient will know when treatment with risperidone is stopped and treatment with paliperidone ER begins. Throughout the study all patients continue to receive antipsychotic medication daily. Patients will continue on the same daily dose of risperidone until their randomly assigned switch to paliperidone ER. All patients will be switched to paliperidone ER over the course of study and once switched continue to take paliperidone ER for the remainder of the study. Paliperidone ER is started at 6 mg/day and can be increased to 9 mg/day or 12 mg/day at the doctor's discretion. Effectiveness and safety will be measured at visits scheduled weekly for the first four weeks and then at the Week 6 endpoint. At each visit, patients will be asked to complete psychiatric tests and questionnaires that will measure effectiveness and patient satisfaction with the medicine. They will also complete tests and evaluations for safety, including electrocardiograms (ECGs, electrical tracings of the heart) and blood samples at the beginning and end of the study. Each patient receives two blinded capsules by mouth once daily in the morning for 6 weeks. Patients taking risperidone receive either a 4-mg or 6-mg capsule plus a placebo capsule. When patients are switched, Paliperidone ER is started at 6 mg/day the day after risperidone is discontinued and can be increased to 9 mg/day or 12 mg/day at the doctor's discretion. Paliperidone 3-mg and 6-mg capsules are combined with placebo to equal the total dose in two capsules., schizophrenia|medication satisfaction, Invega",2
"""Manual Dexterity and Oculomotor Control in Schizophrenia"", 1 - Scientific background and rational Use of sensory cues is essential for execution and correction of voluntary movements. The motor areas and their regulation is of special interest in patients with schizophrenia as there is clear evidence of motor abnormalities independent of the effects of antipsychotic medication, even before the onset of the disorder. Sensorimotor abnormalities have been proposed as a valid endophenotype in schizophrenia. Our global objective is to study and provide vulnerability markers for schizophrenia.||Control of manual dexterity will be assessed by a force sensor (Power Grip Manipulandum, PGM)|Oculomotor movements during behavioral task will be recorded using a video-oculography device|The involvement of cortical inhibition in this volitional inhibition task will be studied by neuronavigation guided TMS coupled to EMG recording||2 - Description of the project methodology There is strong evidence for schizophrenia being a neuro-developmental disorder (Rapoport et al., 2005). It has been shown, for many years, that patients with schizophrenia exhibit abnormal patterns of sensorimotor integration (Manschreck et al., 1982), which is the capacity to integrate different sensory stimuli into appropriate motor actions. It is clinically relevant, in terms of early diagnosis and prevention, whether deficient sensorimotor integration is present in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia, and whether this constitutes a vulnerability marker for the disease.||Our global objective is to study the interactions and related substratum of oculomotor movements during force control task.||The secondary objectives:||(i) To show that increased motor noise is indeed present in schizophrenia. (ii) To show by TMS that cortical excitability in the primary motor cortex (M1) is task-modulated and decreased in schizophrenia.||(iii) Assess the role of deficient cortical inhibition in these behavioral deficits To this end, three different groups of subjects will be studied: schizophrenic patients, non-affected siblings, ultra high risk patients, non-treated schizophrenic patients and healthy control subjects., Sensorimotor Integration|Schizophrenia|TMS|Oculomotor|Motor Control",2
"A Study of Paliperidone Palmitate in Japanese Patients With Schizophrenia, This is an open-label, flexible-dose, multicenter study. The study will consist of 3 periods: an up-to-2-week pre-observation (screening) period, an observation period from Day 1 (baseline) to Week 49 (end of observation period) assessment, and a post-observation period from after the Week 49 (end-of-observation period) assessment to Week 57. For the patients who discontinue the study before the last assessment in Week 49, the post observation period will start after the discontinuation from observation period assessment with follow-up visits at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the last injection. The total duration of the study will be 57 weeks, including the observation and post observation periods. Approximately 200 men and women, aged 20 years or older who meet the DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia at least 1 year before screening and have a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score of 60 to 120 at screening and baseline will be enrolled, so that at least 100 patients complete this 1-year study. The patients who have a primary active Axis I disorder other than schizophrenia will not be enrolled in the study. Eligible patients will be administered an initial loading dose of paliperidone palmitate 150 mg eq. im on Day 1 and 100 mg eq. 1 week later in the deltoid muscle. The study drug will be administered in a flexible dose range of 25 to 150 mg eq. at 4-week intervals from Week 5 as either deltoid or gluteal muscle injections for a total of 11 injections. A dose of 75 mg eq. is recommended from Week 5 until Week 45. The study drug will be administered by a study drug manager and/or injector. Each dose increase should be in increments of 50 mg eq. or less. Dose increases can be considered if there is an increase in the PANSS total score (individual items or the total) or the Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) score from the preceding assessment. Dose decreases can be considered if adverse events occur that appear to have a causal relationship with the investigational drug. The injection site (deltoid or gluteal) will, in principle, be fixed at the fourth injection and thereafter, but injection in the deltoid or gluteal muscle can be alternated at the discretion of the investigator if considered appropriate for the patient's safety. If repeated injections are administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscles, then alternating the side of each injection (left or right) is recommended. The choice of injection needle will be determined by the patient's weight and by the injection site. The weight at baseline (Day 1) will be used when choosing needles for injection from Day 1 to Week 21, and the weight at Week 25 will be used when choosing needles for injection at Week 25 and thereafter. Patients weighing less than 200 lb (<90 kg) will receive their deltoid injection with a 1-inch needle (23 G×1""). Patients weighing 200 lb or more (=90 kg), will receive their deltoid injection with a 1.5-inch needle (22 G×1 1/2""). All gluteal injections will be administered with a 1.5-inch needle (22 G×1 1/2""). The sponsor will collect adverse events starting with the signing of the informed consent form until completion of all end-of-study procedures. Adverse events will be followed by the investigator until it recovers or is considered clinically stable. Adverse events include any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities. Blood samples (preferably fasted), for serum chemistry and hematology and a random urine sample for urinalysis, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, height, weight, waist circumference, Body Mass Index (BMI), Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS), Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), evaluation of the injection site and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for patient's assessment of injection pain will be also collected for safety evaluation. PANSS total score and CGI-S score will be collected for efficacy evaluation. Samples for pharmacokinetic evaluation will be collected at designated timepoints. An optional 10-mL pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected from patients who provide a separate written informed consent for this part of the study. The patients will receive paliperidone palmitate intramuscular (im) as an initial loading dose of 150 mg eq. on treatment Day 1 and 100 mg eq. 1 week later in the deltoid muscle. The study drug will be administered in a flexible dose range of 25 to 150 mg eq. at 4-week intervals from Week 5 as either deltoid or gluteal muscle injections for a total of 11 injections.

"The Effects of Cannabis Use in People With Schizophrenia on Clinical, Neuropsychological and Physiological Phenotypes, The trial will be a double two period (visit) blind cross-over trial with one arm dronabinol 10 mg one arm a placebo control. The order of doses and placebo will be randomized with the restriction that half of the subjects will receive each order. This counterbalances possible visit effects or learning effects associated with the visits. The use of an oral cannabis analog is not equivalent to smoking as the onset of action is slower. This is why people who use dronabinol for chronic pain prefer to smoke cannabis. There is no ""high"" associated with dronabinol. However, the active ingredients are the same, THC, which will have similar effects on the cannabinoid 1 receptor. Ethically, we did not feel we could ask people to smoke cannabis on one day of study. Subjects will present to the GCRC at 5:00 p.m. They will abstain from use of cannabis overnight. The following morning, at 8:00 a.m., the subject will provide a urine sample for a toxicology screen and a blood sample for quantitative THC levels. They will then be administered either 10 mg of dronabinol or an identical placebo on an alternate day. The subject will then have a baseline assessment of clinical positive and negative symptoms measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). The majority (70-90%) of people with schizophrenia smoke cigarettes. Thus, it is likely that in this population that smokes cannabis, 100% will also be cigarette smokers. The effects of nicotine via cigarette smoking on the endophenotypes studied is an acute effect, with a peak at about 5 minutes. To preclude nicotine effects on endophenotypes, we have the patient not smoke for 20 minutes prior to and during testing. Nicotine is quickly removed from the body when inhaled and its effects wear off within 20 minutes. Two hours after administration, the subject will perform the following tests: P50 auditory evoked potential- the recording will consist of the presentation of 5 sets of 16 click pairs with an intrapair interval of 500 ms heard through headphones with a 3-minute rest between sets. Brain wave responses will be recorded; neurocognitive assessment-the California Verbal Learning Test will measure verbal memory and the Stroop will measure inhibition; clinical symptom assessment- The BPRS will again be administered measure positive and negative symptoms; and a blood sample will be collected for quantitative THC levels. They will then be escorted by a Clinical Research Center nurse over to a laboratory at Colorado Psychiatric Hospital to perform smooth pursuit eye movements In performing smooth pursuit eye movements, they will watch a dot moving across a computer screen while infrared sensors that are placed just in front of their eyes record their eye movements. Each subject performs 3 trials of one minute each, with 2 minutes rest between each recording. Subjects will be reassessed by the BPRS for drug exacerbation of symptoms, will have vitals, will be checked for adverse effects, will perform a sobriety test (the standard test used in roadside testing i.e. walking a straight line and finger to nose testing) which will be assessed by Dr. Olincy, who is experienced in assessing sobriety, to assure that the patient is not acutely intoxicated and able to perform normal functions that require coordination. If they fail the sobriety test, they will be asked to remain in the (General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) until they can pass the sobriety test. Otherwise, they will then will be discharged at 5:00 p.m. Transportation to and from the GCRC will be by a provided cab service. Subjects will be randomized in blocks of 4 or 6 to the order in which they receive placebo or dronabinol.

"An Open-Label Trial of Tocilizumab in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a chronic, debilitating disorder with life-long consequences on affected individuals and families. Schizophrenia is also associated with impaired cognition or thinking, which persists despite currently available treatments, and is an important determinant of quality of life and overall function. Associations between immune system abnormalities and schizophrenia, in particular increased inflammation, are one of the more enduring findings in the field. Four of six trials found that treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was associated with significant improvement in psychopathology (Muller et al., 2010a; Muller et al., 2010b). Serum cytokine levels predicted response in two studies (Laan et al., 2010; Muller et al., 2004), and another study found a trend for improved cognition (Muller et al., 2005) with adjunctive NSAID treatment. These findings provide important empirical support for a pathophysiological role for inflammation in a subset of patients with schizophrenia.||Cytokines are key regulators of inflammation that exert effects in the periphery and the brain. IL-6 is a cytokine produced by peripheral blood leukocytes, and central nervous system microglia and astrocytes. Serum IL-6 levels are increased in patients with schizophrenia, and two studies reported significant positive correlations between IL-6 and total psychopathology at baseline and following antipsychotic treatment (Miller et al., 2011). Schizophrenia is associated with impaired cognition, which persists despite current treatments, and is an important determinant of quality of life and overall function. In populations outside of schizophrenia, higher serum IL-6 levels are associated with poorer cognition, cognitive decline, and smaller hippocampal gray matter volume (Marsland et al., 2006; Marsland et al., 2008). In a first-episode psychosis sample, IL-6 messenger ribonucleic acid expression was a significant predictor of smaller left hippocampal volume (Mondelli et al., 2011).||Several other lines of evidence provide a theoretical background for targeting IL-6 in schizophrenia. Polymorphisms of the gene for IL-6 (Paul-Samojedny et al., 2010) and its receptor (Sun et al., 2008) have been associated with schizophrenia. In mice, a single maternal injection of IL-6 during pregnancy caused prepulse and latent inhibition deficits in the adult offspring (Smith et al., 2007). Prenatal maternal infections are a replicated risk factor for schizophrenia (Brown and Derkits, 2010). In a rat prenatal immune activation model, adult offspring have increased serum IL-6 levels, at an age with homology to the usual age of onset of schizophrenia, that are significantly decreased following treatment with haloperidol (Romero et al., 2007; Romero et al., 2010). Another animal study found that ketamine-induced neuronal production of IL-6 is responsible for the activation of brain NADPH-oxidase and subsequent dysfunction of fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (Behrens et al., 2008). These findings provide further support for a potential role of IL-6 in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.||In our Preliminary Study, patients with schizophrenia, age 18-70 and taking non-clozapine antipsychotics, had a fasting blood draw for serum cytokines, and assessment of psychopathology, including cognition. Subjects were not taking NSAIDs, and had no history of immune disorders, illicit drug use in the past month, or antibiotic use in the past 2 weeks. In 39 patients, after controlling for potential confounding effects of age, sex, race, smoking, BMI, socioeconomic status, serum cortisol, psychotropic medications, intelligence quotient, and severity of psychopathology, higher serum IL-6 levels predicted greater cognitive impairment, measured by the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) composite score, in a linear regression model (p=0.002, Figure 1). Higher IL-6 levels were also associated with significantly lower scores on the Verbal Memory (r=-0.40, p<0.01) and Motor Speed (r=-0.42, p<0.01) subtests of the BACS.||In the first year, one clinical trial is planned. We will conduct an 8-week open-label trial to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of tocilizumab as an adjunct to antipsychotic medications in 10 stable outpatients with schizophrenia.||Tocilizumab has not been used before in the treatment of schizophrenia, and using it this way is experimental. The risks that have been found in people with rheumatoid arthritis are known, but there may be unknown risks when used in schizophrenia. Clinically significant adverse drug reactions include anaphylaxis (0.4%), infections (0.1-7.8%), intestinal perforation, neutropenia (7.0%), and cardiac failure. Known side effects of tocilizumab that are common include: increase in hepatic enzymes (AST, ALT), hypertension, headache, neutropenia, infusion-related reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, and nasopharyngitis.||Less common side effects include: peripheral edema, dizziness, rash, increased total cholesterol and LDL, hypothyroidism, diarrhea, abdominal pain, mouth ulcerations, gastric ulcer, stomatitis, weight gain, gastritis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, increased bilirubin, conjunctivitis, nephrolithiasis, bronchitis, cough, dyspnea, herpes simplex. Rare side effects include: cellulitis, fungal infections, diverticulitis, gastroenteritis, herpes zoster, hypertriglyceridemia, malignancy (including breast and colon), multiple sclerosis, otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis, tuberculosis, urinary tract infections, and varicella.||Subjects with schizophrenia will be accessed from outpatient psychiatry clinic at Georgia Health Sciences University or other satellite collaborative sites. The study has 5 visits: screening, baseline, and 2, 4, and 8 weeks. At Screening, all subjects will be administered the evaluation to sign consent, informed consent, and the structured clinical interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual psychosis and affective disorders modules. We will perform a medical history and physical exam, fasting labs (CBC, Complete Metabolic Panel, lipid panel, urinalysis, and urine drug screen (UDS)), a tuberculin skin test, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram. At Baseline, we will perform the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, BACS, and Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI), and draw blood for IL-6 and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP). All subjects will receive a 4 mg/kg infusion of tocilizumab, the recommended starting dose for adults with rheumatoid arthritis. We will contact the subjects by phone on day 1 and 7 after the infusion to assess for any infusion-related events. At Week 2 and 4, we will perform an interval history, physical exam, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, BACS, and CGI. Different versions of the BACS will be used to avoid practice effects. At Week 4, we will obtain fasting labs (CBC, Complete Metabolic Panel, lipid panel, IL-6, hsCRP, and UDS), and subjects will receive a 4 mg/kg infusion of tocilizumab, We will contact the subjects by phone day 1 and 7 after the second infusion to assess for any infusion-related events. At Week 8, we will perform an interval history, physical exam, and administer the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, BACS, CGI, and obtain fasting labs (CBC, Complete Metabolic Panel, lipid panel, IL-6, hsCRP, and UDS).

"Risperidone Augmentation in Patients With Schizophrenia, Specific Aims - We propose a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to study the effectiveness and tolerability of adding risperidone to stable yet only partially remitted patients with schizophrenia maintained on clozapine. We anticipate enrolling a total of 40 subjects over a period of two years at the Freedom Trail Clinic and affiliated sites in Boston, Massachusetts. Our primary outcome measure will be change in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Secondary hypotheses are (1) that the clozapine-risperidone combination is well tolerated, (2) that clozapine levels will not be influenced by risperidone, and (3) that prolactin elevation is suitable as a surrogate marker of sufficient D2 blockade to predict response.||Background - Despite a new generation of antipsychotics, many patients with schizophrenia achieve only partial syndromal remission. In an effort to improve symptomatic and functional outcomes, it has become common practice to combine antipsychotic medications. Since this strategy is largely unproven and expensive, empirical trials are urgently needed. Our group has found in an open trial that adding risperidone to clozapine was well tolerated and led to improvement in psychopathology. Additional support for increasing D2 blockade in clozapine partial responders comes form two small studies using sulpiride and pimozide. We hypothesize that there is a subgroup of patients who might benefit from additional D2 blockade beyond what clozapine alone accomplishes.||Methods - The proposed trial will be placebo-controlled, randomized, and double-blind, and it will last 8 weeks. We expect to enroll 40 subjects overall. Subjects will be eligible if they are diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated with clozapine. In addition, they must have residual symptoms of schizophrenia as we are interested in improvement of residual psychopathology. Subjects with dementia or mental retardation as well as pregnant women will be excluded. After a 2-week placebo lead-in period to assure stable psychopathology and minimize placebo-response, subjects will be randomly allocated to receive 6 weeks of either risperidone (20 subjects), or matching placebo (20 subjects) added onto their customary antipsychotic medication, clozapine. Overall, there are 5 study visits every 2 weeks plus the initial screening visit. On each visit, subjects will be evaluated with standard psychiatric rating scales of psychopathology and side effects. In addition, we will measure serum levels of the medications used, clozapine and risperidone.||Fasting glucose will be measured at screening, week 4, and week 8 visits. This is done to monitor subjects for worsening glucose control. This is a possible concern due to the association between atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, and hyperglycemia. Subjects who are discovered to either have diabetes or develop diabetes during the study, or who have worsening glucose control if diabetic, will be discontinued and referred to their PCP for further work-up and treatment. This additional blood test will not lead to additional blood draws but will simply be added to the subject's routine and mandated biweekly WBC monitoring.||The study endpoint will be a 20% improvement on our primary rating scale of psychopathology, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). No worsening of psychopathology is expected in this trial as subjects are maintained on primary antipsychotic, clozapine.||Benefits - There are no definite benefits to participating in this trial. Subjects will receive a thorough psychiatric evaluation, a review of their pharmacologic treatment, and a physical exam with some baseline laboratory studies. The results of the initial evaluation will be communicated to the treating psychiatrist. Subjects will receive a nominal fee of $20 per study visit (5 study visits are scheduled overall).||The proposed study has direct clinical applications, and it is of theoretical interest. Few data are available from controlled trials to guide clinicians when patients remain symptomatic on clozapine. From a conceptual standpoint, the study will clarify the value of additional D2 blockade for treatment response.||Risks and Discomforts - Risperidone is approved by the FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia. The dose of 4 mg is on the lower end of the dosing recommendations and is usually well tolerated. Possible side effects are sedation, extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, hyperprolactinemia, or orthostatic hypotension. Tardive dyskinesia is a long-term side effect and would not be expected in a 6-week trial. However, existing tardive dyskinesia could worsen.||Blood drawing entails transient discomfort, and it might lead to a hematoma at the site. Being interviewed for clinical symptoms with the help of rating scales can be tiring and upsetting if sensitive psychological experiences are discussed. There is also an association between atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, and hyperglycemia, requiring some monitoring of blood sugars during treatment. No inpatient hospital time is required.||Minimization of Risks - To minimized discomfort from blood draws, the study blood work will be added onto the mandatory blood draws that subjects undergo because they receive clozapine. Vital signs will be monitored at baseline and every two weeks. Side effects will be monitored at baseline and every two weeks. The Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE) will be the primary instrument used to detect side effects. The SAFTEE will be used to tabulate side effects for the yearly IRB summary. Serious adverse events, as well as adverse events, will be reviewed by the PI and reported to the IRB according to institutional policy. The PIs in our group meet weekly to review study protocols and study events.||Fasting glucose will be measured at screening, week 4, and week 8 visits. This is done to monitor subjects for worsening glucose control. This is a possible concern due to the association between atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, and hyperglycemia. Subjects who are discovered to either have diabetes or develop diabetes during the study or who have worsening glucose control (poor glucose control as judged by new-onset diabetes or new-onset glucose intolerance.) will be discontinued and referred to their primary care physician (PCP) for further work-up and treatment. In patients with established diabetes, the six weeks of active treatment will not be long enough to meaningfully judge if diabetes control is more difficult than usual (typical parameters of glucose control such as hemoglobin A1C are a reflection of long-term glucose control, i.e. several months). We will follow those patients clinically in cooperation with the PCP to decide if patients can stay in the trial. This additional blood test will not lead to additional blood draws but will simply be added to the subject's routine and mandated biweekly white blood cell count monitoring.||Patients will be withdrawn from the study if they become suicidal or deteriorate psychiatrically. This will be assessed every 2 weeks using the PANSS and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS): clinical deterioration will be defined as a 20% increase in total PANSS scores, and suicidality will be defined as a rating of ""mild"" (frequent thoughts of being better off dead, or occasional thought of suicide) on the CDSS. Subjects who have worsening symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD) will be discontinued and referred to their psychiatrist for further work-up and treatment (Worsening TD as judged by 20% increase in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS))., Schizophrenia|risperidone|prolactin|clozapine",2

"Effect of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Resting State Brain Activity in Schizophrenia, Background. The sub-Investigator Dr. Mennemeier has been using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat phantom sound perception in subjects with tinnitus. The Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Messias, now aims to team up with Drs. Mennemeier and James, to learn how rTMS influences phantom sound perception in schizophrenia. rTMS has already been shown to be an effective treatment for both tinnitus and schizophrenia. rTMS is a non-invasive method of regional brain stimulation that can significantly reduce phantom sound perception temporarily in 50% of subjects with tinnitus and schizophrenia. This study will go further than previous investigations by analyzing how different frequencies of rTMS influence not only auditory hallucinations (AH) in schizophrenia but also brain connectivity in schizophrenia. The investigators want to learn if rTMS decreases AH by normalizing brain connectivity. Whereas this study focuses on schizophrenic subjects with AH, the design is very similar to ongoing work on tinnitus so the findings will be comparable.||Tinnitus and AH in schizophrenia are prevalent and disabling disorders of sound perception. The investigators understanding of the precise mechanisms of these disorders is lacking. Interestingly, the symptoms of both disorders respond positively to rTMS of the temporal cortex in ways that defy contemporary understanding of the nature of these symptoms and of how rTMS should work to improve them. For example, phantom sound perception in both tinnitus and schizophrenia are linked to maladaptive, hyperactivity of auditory processing regions of temporal cortex; however, it is increasingly clear that these pathological changes alone are insufficient to explain the pronounced intrusiveness and negative emotional valance of symptoms in each disorder. Therefore, a barrier to understanding these disorders lies in understanding how changes in auditory cortex are synchronized with changes in other cortical regions that regulate perception and emotion. Additionally, at present, the decision of which rTMS frequency to apply as a treatment for phantom sound perception has no firm theoretical or empirical basis. Whereas, low frequency rTMS has traditionally been used, based upon contemporary models, to ""inhibit"" hyperactivity in auditory cortex; high frequency rTMS, which should induce an opposite effect on neuronal processing, not only works to improve symptoms but may be more effective for some subjects than low frequency rTMS. Therefore, contemporary models designed to explain how the frequency of rTMS influences neuronal activity immediate following stimulation are insufficient to explain how low and high frequencies of rTMS can mitigate phantom sound perception for days, weeks and months following a single course of treatment.||Hypothesis. The investigators propose that phantom sound perception in schizophrenia result from an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neural process in auditory networks and from synchronized, maladaptive changes in linked brain regions that regulate perception and emotion. Treating auditory cortex with repetitive, external magnetic stimulation can decrease phantom sound perception and distress by reversing the maladaptive brain reorganization that is set in motion by these underlying neural imbalances., Schizophrenia|Auditory hallucinations (AH)|Phantom sound perception|repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)|Percent habituation in the P50 amplitude with 250 ms ISI",2

"Trial of Stimulus-response Potentiation in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 4.0 per 1,000. The introduction of antipsychotic medications in the 1950s resulted in marked clinical improvement in the symptom profile of schizophrenia, nevertheless the disease still contributes to a significant proportion of global disease burden in terms of both morbidity and mortality. In this regard, cognitive deficits and residual negative symptoms are considered major contributing factors to psychosocial disability and poor functional outcome associated with the disorder.||Higher-order cognitive functions; e.g. working memory and executive functions; show variable deficits and are considered a core clinical symptom of schizophrenia. On the other hand, the disorder is also characterized by abnormalities at the basic level of primary sensory processing, i.e. auditory, visual and somatosensory processing. Such abnormalities in the primary process of sensory perception could change the sensory experiences of schizophrenia patients and thus contribute to the psychopathology.||Event-related potentials (ERPs) are the neurophysiological correlates of sensory processing. ERP abnormalities have been widely described in schizophrenia literature: Pre-pulse inhibition of startle (PPI) in which a weaker pre-stimulus (pre-pulse) inhibits the reaction to a subsequent strong startling stimulus (pulse) is impaired in schizophrenia. P50 suppression, a measure of sensory gating, is also often absent or reduced in the disorder. N100; a measure of basic auditory sensory perception; shows significant amplitude reduction in patients compared to controls. Mismatch negativity (MMN), a measure of automatic deviance detection and shows characteristic attenuation in schizophrenia. P300, which is involved in higher-level stimulus evaluation and categorization, also shows abnormalities along the disease course.||In the study by Clapp et al., 2005, auditory high frequency stimulation (tetanizing stimulation) resulted in an increase in auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) in healthy individuals; i.e. an increase in N1 amplitude that persisted even after stimulation. This augmentation of N1 amplitude was regarded as a result of plastic synaptic potentiation similar to long-term potentiation (LTP) described after electrical tetanic stimulation in cellular studies. Similar findings were later replicated by Lei et al., 2017, where they used pure tones, narrow band noises and white noise to induce stable potentiation and augmentation of N1 amplitude., 0",2

"Early Predictors of Poor Treatment Response in Patients With Schizophrenia Treated With Atypical Antipsychotics, Study Design: This study recruited hospitalized adult patients who had a relapse of schizophrenia. All participants had received antipsychotic treatment for a period of time previously. They have to meet the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). One hundred and twenty adult inpatients were recruited and were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (n=60), risperidone (n=30) and paliperidone (n=30) in an allocation ratio of 2:1:1. The participants were allowed to change the dosage of antipsychotics and their hospitalization status according to the judgement of in-charged physicians during the study period.||The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and written informed consents were obtained either directly from the patients or from their legal guardians after the study had been explained. The inclusion criteria for this study were: (1) age 18 to 65 years, (2) no major systemic illnesses based on physical examinations and laboratory test results, and (3) baseline PANSS total score≧60. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) participants not taking any antipsychotics in the previous one month, (2) participants were pregnant and lactating women, and (3) history of clozapine treatment in the previous 3 months, and (4) patients receiving long-acting antipsychotic injections in the preceding 6 months of enrollment.||This study was conducted by a 12-week, open-label and naturalistic randomized design. A tri-therapy (olanzapine, risperidone, and paliperidone) completely randomized design was adopted for this study, which involved three homogeneous groups of patients with a run-in period of 3 months. The patients were required to have discontinued all prior use of antipsychotics for a period of at least 7 days before their entry into the study. During wash-out period, administration of either oral benzodiazpines, hypnotics or injection of lorazepam to control anxiety, insomnia and aggression were allowed. After the wash-out period, the patients received treatment with an atypical antipsychotic drug, olanzapine, risperidone or paliperidone for 3 months.||The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) rating scale was used to evaluate the changes of psychiatric symptoms in each time point. The subject patients were interviewed for the PANSS by senior psychiatrists. The raters in the present study had worked mainly on inpatient treatment of severe schizophrenic patients, and were well acquainted with symptoms of schizophrenia. Prior to the present study, all participating psychiatrists had received adequate training through the manual and they had had clinical experience in the PANSS rating before the study. At each time point if the scores of PANSS showed the patient's symptoms had worsened, the dosage would be adjusted based on the clinical judgment of in-charged senior psychiatrist. However, if the scores of PANSS were improved, the dosage was maintained. The recommended dose for the three groups were as follows: 10 to 20 mg daily for olanzapine, 4 to 6 mg daily for risperidone, and 6 to 12 mg daily for paliperidone. Throughout the study period, the paticipants were allowed to continuously use some concomitant medication, including lorazepam (up to 6 mg/day) for insomnia or agitation and biperiden (up to 6 mg/day) for treatment of extrapyramidal side effects.

"Carnosine and Cognitive Training in Schizophrenia, Compromised cognitive functioning is a core feature of schizophrenia, yet it remains a major unmet need in the treatment of schizophrenia. Current available therapeutic approaches to enhance cognition in schizophrenia - either pharmacological or non-pharmacological (for a review) have yielded, at best, only modest results with questionable retention of the cognitive benefits and generalization of the effects into functional benefit. The investigators propose a novel approach to enhance cognition in schizophrenia: combining a food supplement with cognitive training, rather than using each intervention alone.||Aim is to test the primary hypothesis that the combination of L-carnosine with cognitive training will significantly increase the performance of patients with schizophrenia on memory and learning training tasks compared to pairing cognitive training with placebo. The investigators will also test the secondary hypotheses that in the group receiving L-carnosine increased performance is due to a greater learning rate. Carnosine has antioxidant and antiglycating action and is found in food and the human body. The investigator's choice is guided by several considerations but, primarily the evidence that L-carnosine has neuroprotective effects through its antioxidant features. Briefly, the investigators propose that alterations in metabolism in several neurotransmitter systems (particularly glutamate) can both contribute to, and be modified by, oxidative stress, and therefore antioxidant administration could positively affect neurotransmitter role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory.||Carnosine has shown some improvements in cognitive outcomes in autism (Chez et al, 2002) and schizophrenia (Chengappa et al; unpublished). Chez used oral doses of 800mg/d for 8 weeks; while the latter study used oral doses of 2000mg for 4 weeks showing positive effects. Hence this is the dose and delivery route that will be used. The investigators have opted for 4 weeks course following broadly from these two studies. Carnosine is widely available from health and food supplement shops in the UK and US retail market in highly pure form; is a naturally occurring in food and the human body; and is well-tolerated and has a benign side-effect profile, as shown from previous trials, and is therefore not associated with any potential risks., L-Carnosine|Schizophrenia|Psychosis|Cognition",2

"Trial Evaluating Three Fixed Dosages of Paliperidone Extended-Release (ER) Tablets and Olanzapine in the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia, Paliperidone is being developed as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia.

"Inpatient Evaluation of Adults With Schizophrenia, Objectives:||Schizophrenia and related psychoses are chronic brain disorders whose prognosis is often poor and whose pathophysiology remains obscure. Neuroimaging technologies such as PET (positron emission tomography), fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), DTI (diffusion tensor imaging) and MRSI (magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging) offer opportunities to elucidate the pathophysiology by studying brain function in living research subjects. The use of these techniques to study psychotic disorders is severely limited, however, by a critical methodological confound: antipsychotic treatment. The purpose of this protocol is to admit research subjects with schizophrenia and other related disorders to the Clinical Center, carefully evaluate their neuropsychiatric status, and discontinue psychotropic medications for a brief period so research subjects can be studied without the confound of antipsychotic treatment.||Study Population:||700 participants||The study will include research subjects with schizophrenia.||Study Design:||There are several phases to this protocol. The first phase is the Screening Evaluation and Stabilization Phase and includes gathering historical data, structured diagnostic interviews, general physical and laboratory assessments, basic physiological monitoring, neuropsychological testing, limited collection of blood and urine samples, and serial behavioral ratings. In the second phase (Coded Medication Phase), research subjects will receive blinded compounds that will contain inactive placebo or active antipsychotic administered in a crossover fashion. Patients and unit clinical nursing staff evaluating and caring for the patient will be blind to arm status. Each arm normally lasts 4 to 6 weeks. The total duration of this phase is 8 to 12 weeks. During the Coded Medication Phase, research subjects are enrolled in a series of neuroimaging and other approved studies designed to elucidate the neurobiology of these disorders. These include studies using neuropsychological testing, MEG, PET, fMRI, DTI, and MRSI. The antipsychotic free period is essential to distinguish the effects of illness versus medication.||Outcome Measures:||Parameters under investigation include traits that are candidate phenotypes for genetic studies and state-dependent aspects of brain function. The combined use of many neuroimaging modalities will allow us to look at the functional relationship between a variety of brain abnormalities hypothesized to play a role in schizophrenia. These include hippocampal neurochemical abnormalities, deficits in prefrontal cortical activation, and dysregulation of subcortical dopamine in a single research subject., Schizophrenia|Psychosis|Schizoaffective|Neuroimaging|Cognition|Schizoaffective Disorder",2

"Research of Anatomo-functional Biomarkers in Schizophrenia, The identification of biomarkers of ultra-resistance (UR) to treatment in schizophrenia would allow earlier, better adapted and more effective personalized management of these patients, which would improve their functional prognosis.||An early decrease in functional connectivity (FC) between some rest networks has recently been proposed as an UR biomarker by McNabb et al. Nevertheless, clozapine has, among its side effects, a direct cardiac action that profoundly modifies patient's hemodynamics. However, functional brain imaging techniques are based on BOLD effect which is dependent on these hemodynamic parameters. It is therefore not possible to say whether these differences in FC are inherent to the pathology or whether they are related to clozapine instauration which causes hemodynamic changes that may disturb BOLD signal.||To objectify UR biomarkers, investigators propose a longitudinal follow-up of resistant patients, starting before clozapine instauration and including a multimodal brain imaging assessment (T1 and T2 weighted sequences, DTI, ASL-Perfusion, fMRI- Rest) associated with clinical and biological monitoring. In order to correct the MRI signal of clozapine hemodynamic effects, investigators will develop a new MRI methodology based on the concomitant collection of physiological parameters (blood pressure, electrocardiogram and respiration)., schizo-affective disorder|utra-resistance|clozapine|biomarker|fMRI",2

"A Study of the Long-term Safety and Tolerability and the Long-term Effectiveness of Extended-release Oral Paliperidone in Patients Diagnosed With Schizophrenia, The controlled rate of drug delivery provided by the extended-release oral formulation of paliperidone may provide improved effectiveness and a reduced risk of certain adverse effects in patients with schizophrenia, by avoiding peaks and troughs of drug levels in the blood. This could in turn provide an improved quality of life and overall functioning for patients.||This open-label study is an extension of a 6-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study in which the effectiveness and safety of 4 different oral treatments administered once daily are compared in patients with schizophrenia: paliperidone 6 or 12 milligrams (mg), olanzapine 10 mg (an approved treatment for schizophrenia), or placebo. Following the double-blind treatment phase, eligible patients may enter this 52-week open-label extension with slow, extended-release paliperidone (with no comparison treatments). In the open-label extension, all patients, regardless of their randomized treatment in the double-blind phase, will begin on extended-release paliperidone 9 mg once daily. Thereafter, patients will be maintained on a flexible dosage of extended-release paliperidone throughout the 52-week study. The dosage may be increased or decreased within this range in accordance with the clinical judgment of the investigator, based on observations of patient response and tolerability. Because flexible dosing more closely mimics clinical practice, this design may provide more clinically relevant findings in the open-label setting.The final visit in the double-blind phase may serve as the initial visit for the open-label extension. Study visits will occur at Day 4 and then weekly for the first 4 weeks (Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4) and then every 4 weeks through Week 52 or until early termination.

"Cognitive Remediation for Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is associated with neurocognitive impairment, diminished life satisfaction, lack of independence, and poor functioning in social, occupational and other desired and expected community roles. The personal, social and economic costs of this illness are enormous. Neurocognitive deficits (e.g., slowed thinking, poor attention and memory, inadequate problem solving) are now recognized as core features of the illness, and primary contributors to functional impairment among patients (Bellack, Gold & Buchanan; 1999; Green, 1996). While standard antipsychotic medications improve psychotic symptomatology in many patients, their impact on neurocognition is modest, at best, and dramatic functional deficits remain even after adequate pharmacological treatment (Keefe et al., 1999). Hence, there is growing interest in alternative treatment strategies to address cognitive deficits, including computer-assisted cognitive remediation.||The purpose of this project is to assess the efficacy of a computer-assisted cognitive remediation program we have developed: Computer Assisted Cognitive Remediation (CACR). Fifty individuals with schizophrenia and related disorders will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a) 36 sessions of CACR; or b) 36 sessions of a manualized computer control condition (RC). The efficacy of CACR will be assessed on behavioral performance in three dimensions: (1) on the trained learning exercises, (2) on neuropsychological measures, and (3) on role play based assessments of everyday problem solving. We hypothesize that CACR will be more effective than the control treatment in each domain., treatment|cognition|schizophrenia",2

"Biomarker Strategies for Medication-Enhanced Cognitive Training in Schizophrenia, This R34 application responds to PAR-09-173, to achieve the first goal of this FOA by supporting: ""the development and/or pilot testing of new or adapted interventions."" The two overarching goals of this application are: 1) to test the effects of the acute administration of the NMDA antagonist, memantine (MEM), on sensorimotor gating and working memory (WM) in schizophrenia (SZ) patients, and 2) to assess the feasibility of using MEM to predictably enhance the therapeutic benefits of cognitive training in SZ.||The pharmacotherapy of SZ has been dominated by antidopaminergic drugs with limited clinical impact. Some forms of psychosocial rehabilitation, such as cognitive training (CT), appear to effectively reduce symptoms and improve function in SZ. The premise of this application is that the benefits of CT in SZ might be enhanced by drugs that increase specific cognitive abilities, including WM, even if these pro-cognitive drugs lack clinical impact when administered without CT. The main goal of this application is to develop an innovative intervention strategy that enhances the clinical benefits of CT in SZ through administration of a pro-cognitive agent to biomarker-identified sensitive patients.||The investigators reported that a single dose of the widely used Alzheimer's disease medication, MEM (20 mg p.o.), significantly increased prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex in healthy subjects. PPI-enhancing effects of MEM in healthy subjects are associated with: 1) increased WM; and 2) phenotypes linked to the high activity Val158Met COMT polymorphism. PPI is consistently impaired in SZ patients; lowest levels of PPI in patients are associated with: 1) poor functional outcome; and 2) the Val/Val COMT genotype. If our MEM findings in healthy subjects are reproduced in SZ patients, the investigators will detect MEM-associated improvements in PPI and WM, particularly among Val/Val patients. The investigators will then be positioned to test the hypothesis that acute PPI and WM-enhancing effects of MEM predict therapeutic benefit of MEM in SZ patients undergoing CT.||This application has two aims: Aim 1 will assess the acute effects of MEM (0 vs. 10 or 0 vs. 20 mg p.o.) in 60 SZ patients, to test the prediction that MEM will increase PPI and enhance WM in SZ patients, particularly in those characterized by low basal PPI levels and/or the Val/Val COMT genotype. Mismatch negativity and gamma band synchronization will also be assessed as potentially informative MEM-sensitive and functionally relevant biomarkers. Aim 2 will assess the feasibility of testing the therapeutic benefit of MEM as an adjunct to CT in SZ patients, and the feasibility of testing the primary hypothesis that such benefit will be predicted by increased PPI and/or WM in SZ patients after the Aim 1 single dose MEM challenge. It is predicted that subject recruitment and completion in both arms of a controlled 12-week CT trial in SZ out-patients among subjects completing Aim 1 will be appropriate for testing both the overall effectiveness of MEM as an adjunct to CT and the ability to predict this effectiveness among biomarker-identified patient subgroups., Schizophrenia|prepulse inhibition|neurocognition|working memory|memantine|MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery",2
"Evaluating Two Types of Cognitive Training in Veterans With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a disorder that affects both higher-level neurocognitive operations (e.g., verbal memory, executive functioning) and lower-level perceptual processes (e.g., auditory processing). These deficits contribute to the poor community outcome and severe functional disability seen in patients. Effectively treating the cognitive dysfunction associated with this illness is important to achieve improvements in daily functioning. Recent meta-analytic studies report that cognitive training in schizophrenia has a moderate effect-size impact on cognitive functioning and a lower impact on daily functioning. However, most training interventions for schizophrenia have only targeted higher-order cognitive processes. A few recent interventions have targeted basic perceptual processing and shown that auditory and visual perceptual abilities can be trained and improved in patients with schizophrenia. These findings suggest that basic perceptual processing may be an ideal target for intervention. At this point, it is still unclear whether a neuroplasticity-based, bottom-up intervention is more effective than an intervention that targets top-down functions like attention, working memory, and executive functioning.||This clinical trial will contrast a bottom-up intervention targeting basic auditory processes and a top-down intervention targeting higher-order cognitive functions, compared with a control condition, in Veterans with schizophrenia. These interventions will be assessed by their effects on representative measures from three outcome domains: 1) neurocognition, 2) electroencephalography (EEG), and 3) functional capacity. Participants will be randomly assigned to the bottom-up auditory training, top-down cognitive training, or control treatment (commercial computer games). All treatments will be administered three times a week (1 hour each) for 12 weeks. A comprehensive battery of cognitive, electrophysiological, and functional measures will be administered at baseline, 6 weeks, and at completion of treatment. The investigators will enroll 120 Veterans with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder across the 5 years of the study.||This study will determine which training approach leads to the largest magnitude of improvement in neurocognition, functional capacity, and neural functioning measured with EEG. Moreover, it will shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying the response to training. By determining whether it is more beneficial to treat lower-level perceptual processes or higher-level cognitive functions, the results of this project will inform future recovery-based cognitive remediation interventions for Veterans with schizophrenia., cognitive training|schizophrenia|mismatch negativity|cognition|functional capacity|EEG",2
"Mental Health During the Whole Life Cycle of Community Patients With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is one of the components of severe mental disorders. It has the characteristics of prolonged course, low cure rate, high recurrence rate and high disability rate. It brings many short-term and long-term effects to individuals, families and society.Studies on patients with schizophrenia mainly focus on cross-sectional and case-control studies, but there is a lack of long-term follow-up of patients with schizophrenia in the community. Therefore, this study would establish a cohort study to solve the chronological relationship between exposure and effect, focus on community schizophrenia, and establish a community schizophrenia patient biobank that has been tracked for a long time from diagnosis.||Aim of the study:||1.1 Based on previous studies, this study will focus on patients with schizophrenia in the community. Establishing a biobank of new cases to monitor the occurrence of disease recurrences, violent behaviours and other outcome events during the whole life cycle of schizophrenia patients. Exploring the predictive effects of biological, psychosocial, imaging and other indicators on patient recurrence and other events.||1.2 At the same time, establishing a sample database of patients with schizophrenia in the community to lay a working foundation and reserve sample resources for subsequent related mechanism research, drug research, and intervention research.||Content of the study 2.1 At least 1,200 patients with schizophrenia diagnosed within three years will be recruited. On the basis of community follow-up and health examination, this study will expand biological sample collection and professional scale evaluation, establish a schizophrenia community cohort.||2.2 Based on the establishment of the cohort, this study will carry out statistical description according to the type of data. The differences will be compared between the exposed group and the unexposed group in demographic information, family and past disease history, personal living habits, condition and treatment, psychological evaluation, social support evaluation, sleep quality, functional evaluation, quality of life and other content. Repeated measures analysis of variance will be used to compare the differences in blood pressure, blood glucose and other indicators between the exposed group and the unexposed group. The generalized estimating equation will be used to analyze the relationship between the outcome of recurrence and emergency about physical activity, related biochemical indicators, and social support. On the basis of statistical results, this study will carry out research on the prognostic factors and related physiological mechanisms of schizophrenia.||Study design 3.1 Pay attention to multiple prognostic outcomes such as relapse, dangerous behaviours, suicide and self-harm, calculate the included sample size based on this. After the start of the project, in Hongkou, Jinshan, Minhang, and Xuhui districts, all schizophrenic patients in management who meet the inclusion criteria will be continuously included in the district.||3.2 At baseline, the patient's demographic information and a complete health history (include personal history, family history, and medical history) will be taken.

"A Study to Compare the Effectiveness and Safety of Flexibly Varied Doses of Paliperidone Palmitate and Risperidone in Treating Patients With Schizophrenia, Paliperidone palmitate is being developed as a long-acting intramuscular injectable formulation for the treatment of schizophrenia. Many patients with schizophrenia achieve symptom stability with the available oral antipsychotic medications; however, it is estimated that up to 75% have difficulty adhering to a daily oral treatment regimen. Long-acting injectable formulations may make compliance with the treatment regimen easier by eliminating the need for daily medication. An injectable formulation of risperidone is widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia and has been well tolerated by patients with chronic schizophrenia at the recommended dosage of 25 to 50 milligrams every 2 weeks. The present study is designed to evaluate the comparability of paliperidone palmitate and long-acting injectable risperidone over 1 year of treatment.||This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter comparative study in patients with schizophrenia. The study comprises a screening period of up to 1 week (including periods for washout of psychotropic medications and, if necessary, an oral tolerability test) and a 53-week double-blind treatment period. In the double-blind treatment period, patients will be randomly assigned in equal numbers to receive treatment with either (1) flexibly dosed paliperidone palmitate administered every 4 weeks or (2) flexibly dosed long-acting risperidone administered every 2 weeks. Drug effectiveness and safety will be evaluated periodically throughout the study. Samples for pharmacokinetic evaluation will be collected at designated time points, and a blood sample will be collected at baseline (before the start of the double-blind treatment period) or at any subsequent visit for an optional pharmacogenomic (genetic) analysis. The study hypothesis is that paliperidone palmitate will be as effective as long-acting risperidone in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. Paliperidone palmitate (25, 50, 75, or 100 milligrams (mg) equivalent) every 4 weeks, or long-acting risperidone 25, 37.5, or 50 mg every 2 weeks of double-blind treatment period, injected into the gluteal muscle (buttocks).

"Effects of RG1068 (Secretin) on Information Processing in Schizophrenia, In a recent placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study of Secretin in refractory schizophrenics, we found that a patient who received Secretin (1.0 g/kg) intravenously, showed a marked improvement in eye blink conditioning following infusion. This subject also showed a clinical improvement of > 20% on the Total Score and Total Negative Score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to confirm and extend this observation in a larger group of individuals with schizophrenia. In this 24 to 48 hour experiment, the acquisition and extinction of the conditioned blink response will be assessed in participants with schizophrenia who are randomly assigned to one of two double blind treatment groups: (1) subcutaneous saline or (2) subcutaneous Secretin (20 ug/kg). Enrolled participants will remain on their stable medication regime (i.e., psychotropic medications and related treatments will not be manipulated). Furthermore, given evidence that Secretin administration increases the amygdala's activation during experimental presentation of fear-related facial cue stimuli, we wish to also investigate the effects of the experimental agent on psychophysiological processes putatively related to amygdala function. Prepulse inhibition is a widely studied paradigm in the schizophrenia literature, thought to reflect disruption of early sensory-motor gating that is present in both individuals with schizophrenia and their unaffected biological relatives, and can be mediated by various limbic structures including the amygdala. Therefore, as a secondary aim, the effects of Secretin will be tested on affect modulation, pre-pulse inhibition, and pre-pulse facilitation of the acoustic startle response using common psychophysiological research procedures.

"Glycine and D-Cycloserine in Schizophrenia, To determine if glycine produces improvement in negative symptoms and D-cycloserine produces worsening in symptoms compared to placebo, patients will undergo a double blind study of d-cycloserine and glycine treatment added to clozapine.||Clozapine is more effective for negative symptoms of schizophrenia than conventional neuroleptics, but the neurochemical actions contributing to this superior clinical efficacy remain unclear. Recent evidence points to a role for glutamatergic dysregulation in schizophrenia, as well as important differences between conventional agents and clozapine in effects upon glutamatergic systems. D-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glycine modulatory site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, improves negative symptoms when added to conventional agents and worsens negative symptoms when added to clozapine. High-dose glycine also improves negative symptoms and has provided preliminary evidence suggesting that glycine improves negative symptoms when added to clozapine. Serum concentrations of glycine predicted response to both high-dose glycine and D-cycloserine. Both clozapine and D-cycloserine may improve negative symptoms by activation of the glycine modulatory site of the NMDA receptor complex. Because D-cycloserine is a partial agonist, it may act as an antagonist at the glycine site in the presence of clozapine, whereas the full agonist, glycine, would not be expected to worsen negative symptoms in the presence of clozapine.||This study proposes to administer a fixed-dose of D-cycloserine, glycine, or placebo added to clozapine in 45 patients with schizophrenia. Because assessments are standardized between studies, results from this study can be compared with results from a previous study of D-cycloserine added to conventional neuroleptic.||The study was ultimately suspended before participants were enrolled, due to definitive findings indicating that pairing treatment of D-cycloserine with Clozapine resulted in worsening of negative symptoms., Adult|Amino Acids|Cycloserine|Female|Glycine|Human|Male|N-Methylaspartate|Placebos|Schizophrenia|Amino Acids -- blood|Cycloserine -- *therapeutic use|Glycine -- *therapeutic use|Schizophrenia -- *drug therapy|Schizophrenia -- physiopathology",2

"High Dose D-Serine as Adjuvant Treatment for Recent Onset Schizophrenia, Background: Recent advances in understanding the neurobiology underlying schizophrenia have underscored a pivotal role for a specific receptor for the neurotransmitter glutamate, the NMDA receptor, whose function may be impaired in the disorder. Enhancing transmission at the NMDA receptor may therefore provide a novel mechanism for treating schizophrenia. Over the past decade clinical trials that included supplementation with different compounds enhancing transmission at the NMDA receptor have provided positive results, particularly with D-serine. However, none of these trials focused specifically on young patients with recent onset schizophrenia. In addition, the optimal D-serine dose was not determined, although a preliminary report suggested that higher doses than those used in most studies may provide additional benefit, without significant safety concerns or side effects. Also, the pro-cognitive effects of D-serine were not systematically analyzed, although preliminary data supports a potential role for D-serine in ameliorating the cognitive deficits found in schizophrenia.||Research Design: Over a two year period, 54 patients, male or female, aged 18-30 years who fulfill DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, will be entered into a 12 week, parallel group, double blind, randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of placebo vs. DSR (up to 6000 mg/day) augmentation to standard antipsychotic therapy.

The scale has a good reliability with Cronbach's alpha 0.8.|The subjective sense of influence on the course of schizophrenia The Brief Measure to Assess Perception of the Self-influence on the Disease Course - Version for Schizophrenia consists of five items targeting different aspects of subjective sense of influence on the course of schizophrenia. The scale has satisfactory psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha= 0.78).||4, Psychotic symptoms The severity of delusions and hallucinations were assessed at the baseline and after the intervention with the semi-structured Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (The PSYRATS). The PSYRATS comprises hallucination and delusions subscale, each design to assess psychological aspects of the symptoms on a five point scale from 0 to 4. The items for the hallucination scale are: frequency (PH1); duration (PH2); location (PH3); loudness (PH4); beliefs regarding the origin of voices (PH5); amount of negative content of voices (PH6); degree of negative content (PH7); amount of distress (PH8); intensity of distress (PH9); disruption to life caused by voices (PH10); controlability of voices (PH11). The delusion subscale consists of six items: amount of preoccupation with delusions (PD1); duration of preoccupation with delusions (PD2); conviction (PD3); amount of distress (PD4); intensity of distress (PD5); disruption to life caused by beliefs (PD6). The PSYRATS has good psychometric properties and have been reported being sensitive to symptoms change over time. In addition the Paranoia Checklist which comprises 18 items, each rated on 5 point scale for frequency, distress and degree of conviction, was used in order to assess delusional ideations. The participants were asked to state if they experience different delusional ideation during the last week before filling out the questionnaire.||5. Cognitive Biases. Cognitive Biases Questionnaire for Psychosis consists of 30 vignettes of everyday life scenarios. Participants are asked to imagine themselves as being in the situation and then choose one out of four cognitive responses indicating specific cognitive biases. CBQp comprises of seven subscales: anomalous perceptions (AP); threatening events (TE); intentionalising (I); catastrophising (C); dichotomous thinking (DT); jumping to conclusion (JTC); emotion based reasoning (ER).||In addition two behavioral tasks were used in order to assess the most prominent cognitive biases in schizophrenia, that is to say jumping to conclusion and theory of mind deficits. In the Fish Task the participants are presented with two lakes with different proportion of grey and orange fishes. In the first lake (lake A) there is 80% grey and 20% of orange fishes. The proportion of fishes in the lake B is reversed. Participants are presented with the fisherman who stands between lakes to catch fishes, but he is allowed to do that only from one lake during the entire experiment. Participants on the computer screen were presented with fishes. Two responses were gathered: 1) the participant should make the confidence judgment by indicating from 0-100% how confident they are regarding the fish is from lake A or lake B; 2) whether the participant has enough evidences for the final decision on the fish is from lake A or B. Two alternative versions of the Fish Task were used for pre- and post-test. We analyzed a number of fishes that were considered by participants for the final decision. The less fishes were considered the more the participant has jumping to conclusions tendencies.||Reading the Mind from Eyes Test (RMET,) was used in order to assess the deficits in the theory of mind. The test consists of 36 different faces pictures restricted to eyes area only. Based on the face expression participant is asked to infer the emotional state of the person presented on the picture. We split the original 36 pictures test into two separate tests for the pre- and post-test. In addition to original test we included the conviction question in which participants responded how confident they are in their decisions (100% sure). The RMET test has good psychometric properties and has been used often in schizophrenia.||6.

"Cognitive Remediation for Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia leads to a striking array of negative outcomes, including profound deficits in the ability to fulfill desired and expected community roles. Chronic under employment and unemployment are among the most serious of these consequences. VA treats over 100,000 veterans with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, the majority of whom are unable to work competitively and do not participate in VA vocational rehabilitation programs despite the fact that VA is committed to enhancing the ability of these veterans to work. Within VA, a major vehicle for helping veterans to become employed is the Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) program, yet in FY2001 only 800 of the roughly 14000 veterans treated in CWT had SMI diagnoses, and only a subset of those 800 had schizophrenia. A number of factors contribute to low participation in vocational rehabilitation and poor work outcomes, but recent data suggest that one of the most important is cognitive impairment. People with schizophrenia have significant deficits in multiple areas of neurocognition, including secondary and working memory, attention, and executive functioning. These impairments have been shown to play a major role in functional outcome, including the ability to benefit from rehabilitation and to work. As a result, there has been increasing interest in the potential for improving neurocognitive functioning via cognitive rehabilitation. While several programs have yielded promising data, currently there is no empirically validated approach.The purpose of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative, computer driven cognitive rehabilitation program we have developed: Computer Assisted Cognitive Remediation (CACR). Veterans with schizophrenia who are unemployed and not participating in vocational rehabilitation will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a) 36 sessions of CACR; or b) 36 sessions of a manualized computer control condition (RC). The efficacy of CACR will be assessed on a range of outcome domains, including neuropsychological test, measures of every day and social problem solving, self-reported cognitive functioning and self-efficacy, and work readiness. All subjects will be referred to CWT at the conclusion of treatment and we will assess how many receive work assignments, and work performance (over 3-months) of those who begin work. We hypothesize that CACR will be more effective than the control treatment in each domain.The results of this project could have important implications for treatment of veterans with schizophrenia. CACR is a manualized program that can be administered by BA level staff. If demonstrated to be efficacious, it could be disseminated throughout VA and have a beneficial impact on vocational outcomes and the quality of life of veterans with schizophrenia., cognition|schizophrenia|treatment",2

"Nicotine Effects on Endophenotypes of Schizophrenia, Convergent findings suggest that an altered neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor system may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Nicotine consumption through cigarette smoking might represent a form of self-medication in schizophrenia as nicotine reduces cognitive and physiological deficits in schizophrenia. The present study aims to investigate how nicotine affects attentional and executive schizophrenia endophenotypes and how genetic polymorphisms relating to the cholinergic system might play a role in inter-individual differences in the magnitude of nicotine effects.||Schizophrenia patients, first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients as well as healthy controls will receive transdermal nicotine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study and will be assessed with prepulse inhibition, antisaccades, the continuous performance test, spatial working memory and a verbal memory task. Subjects will be overnight-abstinent smokers and non-smokers. However, the investigators will particularly test non-smokers in order to eliminate confounding effects of nicotine withdrawal and reinstatement.||Main hypotheses:||Schizophrenia patients will perform worse than matched controls in all cognitive tests (validating our endophenotypes).|Nicotine administration will enhance cognitive performance in overnight-abstinent smokers.|Improvement of cognitive performance in smokers with schizophrenia will be stronger than in control smokers.|Improvement of cognitive performance in smoking first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients will be stronger than in control smokers.|Nicotine administration will affect cognitive functioning in non-smoking subjects.|Nicotine administration will improve cognitive functioning in non-smoking schizophrenia patients.|The effects of nicotine in non-smoking subjects are stronger in those subjects who are cognitively more impaired (i.e. performing below the median of the respective group).||The present research contributes to the issue whether nicotinic cholinergic receptor agonists may have therapeutic value in the treatment of cognition in schizophrenia., nicotine|schizophrenia|endophenotype",2

"Adjuvant Treatment With a Glycine Uptake Inhibitor in Participants With Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia (P05695) (MK-8435-001), The primary features of schizophrenia are characterized by positive (irrational thoughts and/or behavior) and negative symptoms. Negative symptoms are the gross absence of normal behavior and emotions, and usually include a general lack of engagement, social withdrawal, and loss of goal-directed behavior.||Negative symptoms may strongly affect daytime activities and quality of life. The effects of currently available antipsychotics on negative symptoms are not satisfactory and leave much room for improvement. MK-8435 (Org 25935) is an investigational drug that may help to correct the above characteristics of schizophrenia by facilitating the messenger function of an amino acid in the brain, called glutamate. Preliminary data suggest that lowered glutamate levels in schizophrenia are associated with a failure to activate relevant areas in the forebrain and with prominent negative symptoms., Negative symptoms|Glycine Uptake inhibitor|Add-on treatment|Second Generation Antipsychotic",2
"Does Acute Oxytocin Administration Enhance Social Cognition in Individuals With Schizophrenia?, Schizophrenia is characterized by the presence of positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganization of thought process and behavior) as well as negative symptoms (blunted affect, alogia, and avolition), neurocognitive deficits, and impaired social cognition. While positive symptoms can often respond well to antipsychotic medications, the latter symptoms are more difficult to treat. In this study, we will focus on social cognition, which is defined as the functions that are engaged during social interactions. Social cognition has been categorized into four main domains: theory of mind, social perception, attributional bias, and emotional processing. Social cognition in patients with schizophrenia has been found to be critical in predicting multiple aspects of community functioning. There are currently two broad approaches to improve social cognition in patients with schizophrenia: pharmacological and psychosocial interventions. While psychosocial interventions (training exercises to target improvement in domains of social cognition) have shown some benefit, their resultant improvements have been limited in their distribution across multiple domains as well as their generalization to improved functioning in the community. Pharmacological trials have yielded mixed results, and there are not any currently available medications that have been consistently found to improve social cognition in patients with schizophrenia2. One potential future therapeutic target for enhancing social cognition is the oxytocin system.||Oxytocin is a nine-amino acid peptide that, in addition to its role in the periphery for regulating lactation and uterine contractions, functions centrally as a neurotransmitter which is involved in multiple aspects of social behavior and related emotions. Specifically, it has been found to modulate emotion recognition, trust, eye contact, empathic accuracy, as well as envy and gloating. Given oxytocin's role in social functioning, in conjunction with the deficits in social functioning found frequently in individuals with schizophrenia, there have been several studies over the past three decades examining the oxytocin system in humans with schizophrenia and in rodent experimental models.||It has been found that individuals with schizophrenia do not show the same level of increase in oxytocin as normal controls in response to trust-related interpersonal interactions, and low plasma oxytocin predicted negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Additionally, it has also been found that plasma oxytocin levels predicted the ability of patients with schizophrenia to identify facial expressions. Finally, it has been found recently that sustained regular administration of intranasal oxytocin significantly reduced both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Thus, there is significant evidence supporting further research studying the effect of oxytocin on social cognition. It is not yet known if exogenous administration of oxytocin will have acute effects on neuropsychological measures of social cognition in individuals with schizophrenia, and this is the focus of this proposed pilot study.||The overall hypothesis guiding this study is that acute oxytocin administration will improve social cognition (as assessed by a composite score comprising two measures of ""low level"" social cognitive processes and two measures of ""high level"" social cognitive processes) in individuals with schizophrenia. Our primary goals are to assess the feasibility of this experimental paradigm and to generate pilot data and obtain estimates of effect sizes which can be used in planning future larger studies., Schizophrenia|Social Intelligence|Perception, Social|Oxytocin",2
"iTBS on Negative Symptoms and Cognitive Function in Schizophrenia, The negative symptoms and cognitive deficits are two core symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, and do not respond well to antipsychotics. There are many researches on the biological mechanism of these two symptoms, and some studies indicated that these two symptoms maybe related to the dysfunction of prefrontal cortex and deficiency of dopamine. rTMS is a safe and non-invasive physical treatment, some studies has been indicated that the high frequency rTMS could increase the excitability of cortex, and has potentials to improve negative symptoms and cognitive function in schizophrenia.Therefore, this study explore the efficacy of iTBS on negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia based on identifying the brain network connection of schizophrenia symptoms.||Firstly, we have used neuroimaging to find the left prefrontal cortex that is responsible for negative symptoms and cognitive function in schizophrenia.

"Trial Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of 2 Fixed Doses of Paliperidone Extended-Release (ER) Tablets in the Treatment of Adult Patients With Schizophrenia, Paliperidone is being developed as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia. The extended-release (ER) formulation of paliperidone was developed to deliver paliperidone at a relatively constant rate over a 24-hour period to improve the tolerability profile and decrease the potential for orthostatic hypotension. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 2 fixed dosages of paliperidone ER compared with placebo in adult patients with schizophrenia. This is a multicenter, double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician will know if placebo or drug is being given and at what dose), randomized (patients will be assigned to different treatment groups based solely on chance), placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study. Patients will be randomized into 1 of 4 treatment groups to receive oral dosages of paliperidone ER 6 mg or 12 mg, olanzapine 10 mg, or placebo once daily for a 6-week period. The study includes a screening period of up to 5 days, followed by 6-week double-blind treatment phase. Following the double-blind treatment phase, eligible patients (those who have completed the 6-week double-blind phase or who discontinue due to lack of efficacy after a minimum of 21 days) may enter a 52-week open-label extension phase with paliperidone ER monotherapy. While patients are hospitalized, efficacy will be assessed twice during the first week and at the end of the second week, and after patients are discharged from the hospital, they will return to have efficacy and safety assessments performed on a weekly basis through the end of the 6-week double-blind phase. Efficacy will be evaluated throughout the 6-week double-blind phase by completion of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression Scale - Severity (CGI-S), Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP), Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale, Revision 4 (SQLS-R4), and Sleep Visual Analog Scale (VAS).

"Multimodal Physical Therapy Program in Schizophrenia, It´s well known that life expectancy of people with severe mental disorders is approximately from 15 to 20 years less compared with general population. The higher mortality risk in this population group reflects a combination of factors: a) increased prevalence of comorbid medical conditions; b) adverse effects of pharmacological treatment; c) higher rates of suicide, accidental and other violent death; d) poorer access to physical healthcare than for the general population. In addition, this vulnerable population has an extremely high prevalence of obesity, nearly twice that of the overall population. Therefore, it is not surprising that persons with serious mental illness have an increased occurrence of weight-related conditions, including heightened risk of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia; in addiction to this, these pathologies are under-diagnosed and under-treated. Environmental issues and unhealthy lifestyle can account for all these conditions, particularly in people with SMI, such as high levels of cigarette smoking, unhealthy diet or sedentary life style. Tendency to isolation and a reduced social network are often obstacles to the practice of physical exercise.||In addition, antipsychotics, in particular atypical antipsychotics, have been associated with weight gain, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, and other cardiac risk factors. Furthermore, the side effects of these medications are one of the most significant barriers to changing their lifestyle.||Finally, the stigma associated with mental illness may also contribute to low levels of participation in mainstream leisure-time physical activities.||Regular practise of physical exercise improves physical and mental health in the general population. A recent systematic review of physical activity and schizophrenia has shown improvement in both positive and negative symptoms, and a general increase in wellbeing of people with schizophrenia. In addition to cardiac and metabolic effects, physical exercise has demonstrated an improvement in both depression and anxiety.||The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal physical activity programme in physical fitness and physical activity level in persons with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.||Secondary objectives are: Evaluate the effect of this intervention in clinical symptomatology; Analyse the effect of this programme in motivating these persons to undertake physical activity; Identify the effect of the program on the physical fitness of the subjects; Evaluate any influence of the program on the self-perception of stigma in the subjects; Evaluate any variation of level of physical activity before and after the study in the subjects; Measure the impact on the quality of life of people who participate in this study; Perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the program.||The present study is a randomized clinical trial to compare the effect of a multimodal, individualized, physical programme of muscular strength, endurance, aerobic training and health education against a control group.||All variables will be measured at the beginning and the end of the 12-week program by the same evaluator, whose group of subjects will be randomly allocated to the trial group and control group without their knowledge. Furthermore, the variables will be measured 9 months after the end of the program.

"Computerized Cognitive Training for Schizophrenia in Brazil, Cognitive impairments are important determinants of functional outcome in schizophrenia, which are inadequately treated by antipsychotic medication. Neuroplasticity based computerized cognitive trainings have been emerging for the last two decades and are an attempt to help patients with their cognitive impairments and global functioning.||The aim of this study is to perform a computerized cognitive training to improve attention, concentration, learning, clinical symptoms and quality of life in patients. The investigators are interested in testing the differential efficacy between a specific visual versus auditory computerized cognitive training and explore the biological markers that may be involved in these neuroplasticity based training processes.||The investigators will conduct a 40 hours computerized, adaptable, perception specific, cognitive training program in patients with schizophrenia. Patients will come for 1 hour, daily, and perform a visual or auditory training, or control games for about 2 months. Visual and auditory exercises are chosen to be the equivalent of one another and target cognitive domains such as divided attention, working memory and social cognition. Clinical, cognitive, emotional and biomarker data will be collected before the training, half way through, and after the training, to assess progress in several aspects of their functioning and biology.||The investigators hypothesize visual and auditory trainings will be effective as compared to the control games. They also expect that auditory training to be more efficient compared to the visual training because it targets sensory functions that are mostly impaired in schizophrenia, due to auditory hallucinations patients experience. The investigators also hypothesize that both trainings will improve clinical symptoms and quality of life. On a more exploratory analysis, the investigators expect to identify new biological markers of cognitive neuroplasticity, which they expect will differentiate visual and auditory paths., cognitive training",2

"Music Therapy Towards Schizophrenia, Negative Symptoms, Schizophrenia includes 1 % of the Population in Denmark (DK) and often ends up to be chronically. Negative Symptoms are difficult to reduce by Medication and Psychosocial Treatment Possibilities are searched for. Three Cochrane Reviews (2005, 2011, 2017) have been conducted concerning Music Therapy and Schizophrenia with Positive Results.

"Schizophrenia and Physical Exercise, Schizophrenia is a serious mental disease characterized by a combination of positive and negative symptoms, and it is associated with social and occupational dysfunction. The positive symptoms reflect an excess or distortion of normal functions (delusions, hallucinations and disorganized behavior), whereas the negative symptoms are related to flattened affect, alogia, avolition and decreased cognitive function. One recent study reported that schizophrenia is associated with distortions of reality, changes in perceptions and thoughts, difficulties in social situations and problems with daily functions.||Schizophrenia generally appears at the end of adolescence or at the beginning of adulthood and affects approximately 1% of the population. The disease has a deteriorating course and does not involve large neurological changes. Its etiology may be explained by interactions between factors associated with genetic susceptibility and adverse environmental factors. Recently, it has been hypothesized that alterations in neuroplasticity may be an important factor for the development of schizophrenia.||IGF-1 is an important growth factor that induces neuroplasticity (neuronal survival, cell differentiation, cell proliferation, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis). Schizophrenic patients have lower serum IGF-1 levels than healthy individuals. Because IGF-1 levels are lower in schizophrenic patients and this is associated with the etiology of the disease, it is important to investigate treatments that may increase serum IGF-1. Antipsychotic drugs such as olanzapine stimulate the phosphorylation of AKT, which is part of the main downstream pathway of IGF-1. It is possible to activate AKT through several intracellular signals and receptors, including activation of the insulin receptor (IR). However, activation of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) appears to be the main activator of AKT phosphorylation.||In addition to antipsychotic medications, resistance exercises may be another way to increase IGF-1 concentrations. This type of physical exercise has been growing in popularity in society. In recent years, evidence has shown benefits from this exercise for different age groups in both healthy and sick individuals, and it has been indicated to augment bone mineral mass, strength and muscular mass; to prevent or treat sarcopenia; to decrease frailty and functional impairment; and to improve cognitive function and hypertension, among other benefits.||Studies conducted with the young and the elderly who underwent resistance training have shown increased serum IGF-1 levels. However, studies showing the effects of resistance training on schizophrenia and serum IGF-1 levels have not been performed. Studying resistance training is important for several reasons. Importantly, it is a low-cost treatment that may be a possible therapeutic tool, not only to increase IGF-1 concentrations but also to decrease disease symptoms, especially negative symptoms, and the side effects of antipsychotic drugs (extrapyramidal effects, weight gain and tiredness), which may improve quality of life. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of 20 weeks of resistance training on psychotic and depressive symptoms, quality of life and serum IGF-1 concentration., Physical exercise|IGF-1|Schizophrenia|neuroplasticity",2
"Study of add-on Ramelteon Therapy on Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disruption in Patients With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a mental dysfunction of thought, perception and behaviour which can be attributed to complex and dynamically interacting perturbations in multiple neurochemical systems. Along with these cardinal features of schizophrenia, sleep disorders and disturbed circadian rhythm are commonly encountered among patients. Markedly decreased sleep efficiency, delayed sleep onset and frequent awakenings are most common observations. Endogenous melatonin is a dependable biomarker of circadian rhythmicity and, it has already been found that the nocturnal rise of endogenous melatonin is blunted leading to circadian dysrhythmia in schizophrenia.||The antipsychotics prescribed for the condition though cause improvement in the cardinal symptoms of the disease but have no significant effect on melatonin levels. The blunted peak of night time melatonin secretion are not restored or even decreased even after several months therapy with antipsychotics. In this clinical scenario, add-on therapy with sedative/ hypnotics along with antipsychotics is mandate for a prescription. Previous studies revealed that add-on therapy with benzodiazepines can worsen the already existing derangement in circadian rhythm by decreasing secretion of nocturnal melatonin. A long term add on therapy with benzodiazepines in patients on antipsychotics has been found to have an increased risk of death.||Addition of melatonin to the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia elevates mood and daytime functioning in addition to improved sleep in schizophrenia patients. Melatonin, apart from being a hypnotic and circadian rhythm restoring compound, also possess neuroprotective, anti-neuroinflammatory and antioxidant properties. The rate limiting step of melatonin biosynthetic pathway is the alkylation of serotonin to N- acetyl serotonin, catalyzed by enzyme AANAT (aryl-alkylamine- N-acetyl-transferase). Study of AANAT enzyme and its modulation to achieve normal rhythmical secretion of melatonin can also be a potential target for resynchronising the circadian rhythm.||Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist approved for treatment of insomnia by the USFDA. It exerts its action by acting on MT1 and MT2 receptors at suprachiasmatic nucleus. The long term safety of ramelteon has been evaluated by several workers and found no significant adverse effects like abuse liability, rebound insomnia and cognitive impairment. In contrast to melatonin, it shows higher-binding affinity for MT1 and MT2 receptors, more lipophilic and has a longer half-life(t1/2 of melatonin is 20-50 min whereas that of ramelteon is 1-2.6 hrs and that of its active melabolite M-II is 2-5 hrs). In addition, ramelteon has been already evaluated as a potential adjunctive treatment for learning and memory deficits in schizophrenia.||The sleep and circadian rhythm disorders in schizophrenia have so far been given very less importance by researchers and there are limited studies targeting or modulating the melatonin pathway. Therefore, proposed study has been planned to evaluate the effect of add-on ramelteon on sleep pattern/quality and circadian rhythm disruption in patients with schizophrenia., 0",2

"SCIT Versus TAR for Outpatients With Schizophrenia, In recent years, there has been an interest in the development of intervention programs focused on the social cognition for people with schizophrenia (Andres et al., 2001; P Penn et al. 2005). At least, five reviews and one meta-analysis have been conducted to date, which demonstrate promising results of the effectiveness of such interventions on social cognitive deficits and functional outcomes (Tan et al; 2016; Choi et al., 2009; Horan et al., 2008; Kurtz and Richardson, 2012; Statucka and Walder, 2013; Wolwer et al., 2010). Some approaches are focused on one specific domain of social cognition (""targeted"" interventions, such as the Training in Affect Recognition (TAR, Wolwer et al., 2005), and others incorporate multiple domains to create more complex, eclectic programs (""broad-based"" interventions, such as the Social Cognition and Interaction Training (SCIT; Penn et al. 2007; Kurtz & Richardson, 2012).||TAR (Frommann et al., 2003) is one of the social cognition interventions with greater empirical support (Statucka & Walder, 2016) and has been shown to effectively attenuate facial affect recognition deficits in patients with schizophrenia (Wölwer et al. 2005; Wölwer and Frommann 2011; Sachs et al. 2012; Luckhaus et al. 2013). TAR teaches compensation strategies using errorless learning principles, positive reinforcement, feature abstraction, self-instruction and, most importantly, verbalization of characteristic features of facial affect. In a randomized controlled trial, the TAR group achieved significant improvements in facial affect recognition -in particular in recognizing sad faces- and in the quality of life domain social relationship. Furthermore, the TAR training contributed to enhancing some aspects of cognitive functioning and negative symptoms (Sachs et al, 2012). In the other hand, SCIT is a 24-session manual-based group treatment, including elements of cognitive behavioral therapy and social skills training. It is designed for those with schizophrenia spectrum disorders to improve social functioning by enhancing social cognition. Across different studies and research groups, SCIT has been also shown to improve in emotion perception, theory of mind (ToM), and social functioning (Bartholomeusz et al., 2013; Combs et al., 2007; Hasson-Ohayon, 2014; Parker et al. 2013; Penn et al., 2007; Roberts & Penn, 2009; Roberts et al. 2010; Roberts et al., 2014, 2016; Wang et al., 2013).||The efficacy of both interventions has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials compared to ""treatment as usual"", occupational therapy or cognitive remediation (Kurtz et al. 2016) but to date no study has compared the efficacy of two different social cognitive interventions (a direct comparison design). A more precise knowledge about the effect of each intervention on the 4 main domains of social cognition (affect recognition, theory of mind, attributional style and social perception) is needed, and this would enable to identify potential candidates for each program.||The present work consists of a randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of two interventions based on social cognition training in outpatients with schizophrenia. The investigators sought to compare the effect of a ""targeted"" (TAR) and a ""broad-based"" (SCIT) intervention on schizophrenia patients' performance in facial affect recognition, theory of mind and attributional style. Secondarily, the investigators compare the effect on symptomatology, general cognition and functioning. The main hypothesis was that the patient group receiving TAR would exhibit a greater improvement in emotion recognition performance at the post-intervention assessment in comparison to patients receiving the SCIT, and, conversely, patients receiving SCIT would show more effect in ToM and attributional style. To assess the durability of these effects, performance in measures of social cognition, basic cognitive functioning, symptomatology and functional capacity were assessed before (T0), after treatment (T1) and 3 months later (T2).||2. Methods||2.1. Participants Outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (SCID-P; First et al. 1994) with stable symptoms in the range from 18 to 65 years were included into the study. Patients were recruited from 4 Mental Healt Centers in Madrid, Barcelona, Zaragoza and Teruel (Spain). All were clinically stable, without any psychiatric hospitalizations in the last 3 months, with the same antipsychotic medication during the previous 6 weeks, and no planned change in the drug regime for the next 3 months. Exclusion criteria were: 1. Disorders other than schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, according to DSM-IV diagnosis criteria; 2. Additional axis-I or axis-II diagnosis; 3. Dependence to alcohol or other drugs (except nicotine); 4. Serious somatic disorders or organic brain damage; 5. Mental retardation or difficulty speaking or understanding the Spanish language.||The study was approved by the loval ethics committee and all participants gave their informed consent. Overall 100 participants were randomized either to TAR group (n = 49) or to the SCIT group (n = 51) (Consort diagram, Graphic 1).||2.1.1. Treatment||TAR is a 12-session training on facial affect recognition over a period of 6 weeks. Treatment includes one therapist (psychiatrist or clinical psychologist) and 2 patients. It involves neuropsychological strategies, such as restitution and compensation, as well as principles of errorless learning, direct positive reinforcement, verbalization and self-instruction (Frommann et al., 2003; Wölwer et al., 2005). The program is divided into three blocks, whereas each block consists of 4 sessions: during the first block patients learn to identify and discriminate the prototypical facial signs of the six basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger and surprise). The next block aims at a more holistic processing mode with fast decisions, relying on first impression, nonverbal processing and recognition of facial expressions with small intensities. The third block deals with the role of facial emotions in social, behavioral and situational context. Baseline assessments (T0=pre-treatment) were performed after enrolment to the study and post treatment assessments (T1=post-treatment) after the end of the training period (Sachs et al. 2012).||SCIT is a manual-based group intervention that is delivered in 20-24weekly, hour-long sessions. Groups include two clinicians and six to ten patients. SCIT uses a combination of psychoeducation, drill-and-repeat skill practice, strategy games, heuristic rehearsal, and homework assignments to remediate deficits and decrease biases in social cognition. Each SCIT group participant was encouraged to identify a 'practice partner', a family member or acquaintance who was willing to practice SCIT skills with the participant weekly in lieu of, or in addition to, traditional homework. SCIT clinicians attempted to reach practice partners by phone each week to check -in and provide guidance in their efforts to support SCIT participants' learning (Roberts et al. 2014)., social cognition|psychotherapy|rehabilitation|theory of mind",2

"Effects of Pilates Exercise Program in Patients With Schizophrenia, Pilates exercises developed by Joseph Pilates has an increasing popularity in last decades. Pilates supposed that the balance between body and mind is an important factor in achieving health and happiness. Pilates stimulates the mind and decreases mental strain. The basic principles of Pilates-based approach are concentration, control, centering, diaphragmatic breathing, lightness, precision, and relaxation. It also aims to enlighten the awareness of body by inducing mind control. The control of large group muscles with coordination and focusing on breathing may increase aerobic capacity, and further improves mental health. Heretofore, some researchers also reported that the holistic approach of Pilates-based training may provide physical and psychological improvements on human health, and various intensities benefit the quality of life, mental health, physical fitness levels, and body types. Pilates exercises are utilized with a wide range spectrum for many diseases' management and are particularly used also for mental health disease such as depression, anxiety, mood etc. The sample of the study consisted of patients who were diagnosed with schizophrenia according to The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Current study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and its subsequent amendments. All the subjects volunteered to participate in this research and signed the informed consent form approved by the Institutional Clinical Research Ethics Committee (Protocol no: 2015-84-21/10). On receipt of a completed consent form, patients were assigned to Pilates exercise group (PEG) or control group (CG) based on their willingness., Pilates exercise",2

"Trial of D-Cycloserine in Schizophrenia, To characterize further the effects of D-cycloserine augmentation of antipsychotic treatment on negative symptoms, performance on neurocognitive tasks, and on markers for glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic function in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. To determine if negative symptoms and cognitive function improve over time, if these improvements meaningfully impact quality of life factors, if they correlate with markers of neuronal function, and if subpopulations can be identified according to response.||Dysfunction of glutamatergic neuronal systems has recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia based on the finding that non-competitive inhibitors of the NMDA receptor can reproduce in normals the positive symptoms, negative symptoms and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. Furthermore, glutamatergic dysfunction may alter forebrain dopaminergic neuronal activity, a system central to the antipsychotic action of typical neuroleptics. It is believed that enhancing NMDA receptor function by systemic treatment with D-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glycine modulatory site of the NMDA receptor, will reduce symptoms in schizophrenia.||Sixty schizophrenic outpatients with prominent, primary negative symptoms are treated with antipsychotic medication and are randomly assigned to D-cycloserine or placebo for a 6-month, fixed-dose trial. The primary outcome measure is the total score on the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS).

"Impact of Inflammation on Reward Circuits, Motivational Deficits and Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that affects 1% of the population, but accounts for over $60 billion in costs to the national healthcare system. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia, including motivational deficits, are some of the most debilitating aspects of the disorder, being both difficult to treat and representing one of the most significant barriers to functional recovery. One pathophysiologic pathway that may contribute to these alterations in reward circuitry in schizophrenia is inflammation. Increased inflammation has been reliably linked to deficits in reward processing and decreased motivation via effects of inflammatory cytokines on regions of the basal ganglia, including the ventral striatum. Previous findings show that some patients with schizophrenia reliably exhibit elevated concentrations of inflammatory markers and that inflammatory cytokines may be related to negative symptoms including decreased motivation. Relevant to the impact of inflammation on insulin signaling, measures of insulin sensitivity are significantly worse in patients with schizophrenia, including at illness onset. Moreover, antipsychotic medications lead to metabolic syndrome, contributing to risk for insulin resistance and ultimately diabetes. Insulin resistance is believed to be caused by increased inflammation, and in turn can contribute to inflammation through alterations in glucose metabolism.||This study uses an oral glucose tolerance test to test the hypothesis that insulin resistance drives inflammation. The researchers will recruit subjects with a range of insulin resistance, as measured by the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). This will allow the researchers to investigate the contributions of metabolic dysfunction and inflammation on inflammatory and metabolic markers, brain reward circuitry, motivational deficits, and negative symptoms., Inflammation|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)|Negative Symptoms",2

The efficacy and safety of augmenting antipsychotic treatment with L-theanine will be analyzed.||The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) will be administered at commencement and completion of the study. The CANTAB battery consists of a series of interrelated computerized tests of visual and movement skills, attention and memory, and executive function, administered via a touch sensitive screen. The nonverbal nature of the CANTAB tests makes them largely language independent and culture free. These tests are run on an IBM-compatible personal computer with a touch-sensitive screen. Neuropsychological testing lasts approximately 2 hours. Subjects complete the tests in a fixed order with a break half-way through the testing session. For a description of the nature of these tests, the performance measures used, and how the test scores are derived, see (http://www.cantab.com/cantab/site/home.acds).

"Galantamine for Cognitive Deficits in Schizophrenia, The proposed study will entail a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of acute doses of the nAChR allosteric modulator galantamine hydrochloride (0, 4 and 8 mg) on neurocognitive measures in schizophrenic smokers (n=20) and schizophrenic non-smokers (n=10) in a human laboratory paradigm. After training on a battery of neurocognitive assessments, all subjects will be studied during three separate test weeks where they will complete the neurocognitive batter at baseline, and then again after acute administration of the three doses of galantamine in a counterbalanced order across subjects in each experimental group. Specifically, smokers would be randomized into one of two groups: 1) those who undergo overnight smoking abstinence prior to the study cognitive sessions in order to determine galantamine's effects on abstinence-induced cognitive impairment, and 2) those who may smoke as usual prior to the study cognitive sessions. The inclusion of nonsmokers will allow for the assessment of galantamine's effects on cognitive deficits in schizophrenia independent of cigarette smoking. Finally, genetic variations in key metabolic genes involved in catecholamine metabolism (COMT and DBH) would be evaluated as determinants of galantamine-related improvements in cognitive performance in schizophrenic smokers and nonsmokers.||We predict that galantamine will dose-dependently improve selected cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia (e.g., spatial working memory, sustained attention and prepulse inhibition) which we have previously shown are selectively improved by cigarette smoking in smokers with schizophrenia [18], and that this effect would be more pronounced in nonsmokers with schizophrenia. If our results are positive, they would support the rationale for controlled clinical trials using nAChR agonists like galantamine to treat selected domains of cognitive dysfunction in this disorder.||Study Design:||The following experimental groups will be studied:||Schizophrenic Smokers under abstinence conditions (n=10)|Schizophrenic Smokers in the smoking condition. (n=10)|Schizophrenic Nonsmokers (n=10)||Three acute doses of galantamine (GAL) will be tested (0, 4 and 8 mg) in all subjects during three separate test sessions separated by at least 3 days, with study medication doses across sequential subjects given in a randomized, counterbalanced manner.||Smokers (n=20) and nonsmokers (n=10) with schizophrenia will be recruited from the outpatient division of The Connecticut Mental Health Center (CMHC) in New Haven, CT, and it's affiliated satellite centers (Hispanic Clinic, West Haven Mental Health Center, and Yale Behavioral Mental Health Center).||Screening Procedures:||All potential subjects would meet with study staff over 2-3 intake and evaluation sessions to determine study eligibility, which would typically take place within 4 weeks of study enrollment. A description of the evaluation measures is given below:||The screening evaluation will include completion of informed consent forms, a urine toxicology screen to screen for recent use of illegal substances, a urine pregnancy test for female subjects, a psychiatric evaluation using the SCID for DSM-IV disorders, PANSS, AIMS, Webster, Barnes, BDI, Tiffany Questionnaire for Smoking Urges (T-QSU), Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (M-NWS), Shipley Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ), a blood draw for plasma nicotine, plasma cotinine, as well as CBC and LFT's, and a physical examination conducted by Dr. George. Subjects will be separately consented for the genetics portion of the study and blood will be taken for genotyping purposes. Finally, a pre-study neuropsychological testing session would be performed in order to orient and train participants on the laboratory procedures. Subjects who are pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant will not be eligible to participate.||We will compensate all subjects who complete the screening and evaluation process ($25.00) and the neurocognitive training session ($25.00) for a total of $50.00. In addition, subjects would be paid $25.00 for donating a blood sample for genotyping.||Blood for genotyping will be obtained for COMT and DBH polymorphisms in smokers and nonsmokers in schizophrenia participating in this study. The genotyping for these studies will be done in collaboration with the Psychiatric Genetics laboratory of Joseph F. Cubells, M.D., Ph.D. at Emory University.||Experimental Procedures: Smokers will be tested on the cognitive battery at baseline (Day 1, with periodic smoking breaks to minimize nicotine withdrawal), and then again 24 hours later after overnight smoking abstinence (Day 2). Non-smokers will be tested at baseline (Day 1) and again 24 hours later (Day 2). Study medications will be given as a single dose before the Day 2 session which will produce ascending plasma drug levels (t= ½ 5/7 h) during the two hour testing session, in a counterbalanced dosing schedule of galantamine hydrobromide (0, 4, and 8 mg) within each test group. If systolic blood pressure is below 90 mm Hg, the galantamine study medication will be held. Before and after each session (Day 1 and Day 2), clinical ratings using the PANSS, HDRS, extrapyramidal ratings, and adverse event ratings would be completed. For smokers, pre-session tobacco craving and withdrawal ratings, expired breath carbon monoxide, and plasma cotinine and nicotine levels would be obtained. Smokers randomized to the abstinence condition would receive $150.00 for successful completion of each of the subsequent three test session procedures requiring overnight abstinence ($50.00 for successful abstinence, and $100.00 for subsequent testing session completion). Smokers randomized to the non-abstinence condition would be also receiving $150.00 for successful completion of each of the three test session procedures in order to maintain consistency.

"Fingolimod in Schizophrenia Patients, Study Design:||This will be a single site safety and proof of concept study conducted at the Indiana University Psychotic Disorders Program. Forty subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders will be randomized 1:1 to double-blind treatment with fingolimod or matched placebo for duration of 8 weeks.||All subjects will be admitted to the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute Clinical Research Center (CRC) and remain hospitalized for the first 24 (+/- 2) hours post initial dose of study medication. The CRC is located in Indiana University Hospital and has 24 hour staffing with nurses skilled in conducting Phase 1 and Phase 2 investigational drug studies.||Background and Rationale:||Schizophrenia is a severe brain disorder that begins during the teenage years and early twenties and typically progresses to a life-long chronic illness marked by psychotic symptoms, cognitive impairment and poor functioning. A leading hypothesis to account for the symptoms and cognitive dysfunction of this disorder is that abnormalities exist in cortical circuits, particularly in frontal and temporal areas. An interest in cortical circuitry has led to a focus on the integrity of cortical white matter tracts as possibly contributing to the pathophysiology of this illness. Indeed, several lines of evidence have supported abnormalities in white matter structure and function in schizophrenia. Numerous myelin-related genes and their functional expression have been associated with schizophrenia. Moreover, quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in prefrontal cortical oligodendrocytes have been found in postmortem studies. MRI-determined volumetric reductions in prefrontal white matter have been reported in schizophrenia. Advances in MRI technology have enhanced the ability to study white matter pathology in vivo. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fractional anisotropy (FA) provides an assessment of the density and integrity of white matter tracts. Decreased FA has been reported in many de-myelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS), leukodystrophies, and HIV. Numerous studies using DTI have reported decrements in FA in schizophrenia with the most consistent abnormalities occurring in frontal cortical white matter. Also, FA has been shown to be sensitive to therapeutic drug effects in MS which supports DTI-derived FA as an outcome measure in clinical trials of neuroprotective agents.||Fingolimod (FTY720, approved as Gilenya™ ) is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator and recently licensed in the USA and several other countries for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). It is administered as a once per day oral preparation. In registration clinical trials, it had positive effects on brain atrophy, MRI-determined axonal lesions and relapse rates. Significant improvement in the mean number of MRI assessed T1 gadolinium (Gd) enhanced lesions/patient and the percentage of patients free of T1 Gd-enhanced lesions was observed within 6 months of treatment and there was evidence of clinical improvement as early as 2 months after treatment initiation, psychosis|schizophrenia|cognition|fingolimod",2

"Oxytocin as Adjunctive Therapy for Schizophrenia, The project has two main aims:||Aims of the cross-over study To assess the efficacy of intranasal OXT in reducing negative symptoms in patients with SZ (as evaluated with PANSS), in association with standard Second Generation Antipsychotics (SGA)treatment; recruited patients will be aged 18-45 years and will have a disorder duration of no longer than 10 years.|Aims of the neuropsychological assessment To use an Emotional Priming Paradigm (EPP) task to assess pre- and post-treatment change in the patients general cognitive and emotional status.||The investigators aim at treating a large sample size of patients with schizophrenia, consisting exclusively of patients with a limited disorder duration and rather young age, for a sufficiently long period of time. Our rationale for employing a longer treatment period than used in previous and on-going trials is to ascertain the possibility of a positive OXT dose-response relationship, which would be observable, however, with longer treatment exposure. Moreover, only patients with a disorder onset of 10 years or less will be enrolled.||They will then be standardized in terms of AP treatment and randomized to OXT or placebo for 8 months.||OXT is a hormone that is naturally present in the human body, and recent studies have suggested that patients with SZ show low levels of this neuropeptide. It is therefore hypothesized that the treatment proposed in this project might balance apparently lower OXT levels in these patients.||Finally, another innovative aspect of this project is the attention at ameliorating patients adherence to treatment by supporting them with a reminder program (automatic SMS will be sent every morning to remind patients the daily OXT self-administration) and involving a trustworthy caregiver who will be trained in OXT administration and will be asked to monitor the patient compliance by recording each self-administration on a written form., Schizophrenia|Oxytocin|RCT",2
"Yoga as Cognitive Remediation in Schizophrenia, Cognitive impairment is a hallmark of schizophrenia (SZ). It affects the outcome of the disorder and markedly increases its burden. Various biological and psychological approaches are being tested to enhance cognitive capacity of these individuals, but the beneficial effects are modest. Yoga, the ancient Indian science of physical and mental fitness, offers a holistic approach to healthy life style and cognitive enhancement. Many studies have shown benefits of yoga for healthy individuals, and a few for psychiatric disorders. Despite its wide popularity, there are only a limited number of randomized, controlled yoga studies using objective quantitative outcome measures. Our preliminary studies have shown significant and substantial improvement in several domains of cognitive functioning among outpatients with SZ, using a simplified regimen in an open design. It is not clear if the benefits are due to physical activity alone or the entire yoga process per se. We propose to evaluate these results further, using a systematic random assignment design.||Explanatory model: The practice of yoga emphasizes body awareness and involves focusing one's attention on breathing or specific muscles or parts of body. We propose that the beneficial effects of yoga therapy (YT) observed in our preliminary studies relates to improvement in attention that extends to other cognitive domains.||Hypotheses:||Yoga enhances attention, as well as related cognitive function among persons with schizophrenia.|Yoga has beneficial effects on the short term functional outcome of schizophrenia.||Design: A systematic, single blind randomly assigned supplementation of routine outpatient training with yoga, compared with standard physical exercise and treatment as usual.||Specific Aims:||We propose to evaluate consenting outpatients with SZ undergoing treatment at the Department of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research-Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital (PGIMER-RMLH), Delhi India (n= 258).

"Efficacy of Lu 31-130 in Patients With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a serious and disabling mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the world's population. Antipsychotic drugs remain the cornerstone in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia. However, none of the available drugs is ideal, in particular because of their complex safety profile and the limited effectiveness against certain symptoms of the disease. Thus, only one dimension of the morbidity, that is, the positive symptoms, can be expected to respond to treatment whereas negative symptoms and cognitive deficits are, at best, only marginally targeted.||Given this, there is no doubt that the current antipsychotic drugs leave much room for improvement and call for new, more effective pharmacotherapies in the treatment of schizophrenia. In the current study, patients suffering from schizophrenia and experiencing clinically significant symptoms of the disease will be included. In the current study, eligible patients will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to blinded treatment with either Lu 31-130 (3, 5, 7, 10 or 14 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. The study includes 5 parts with increasing doses of Lu 31-130 (Part A [3 mg/day], B [5 mg/day], C [7 mg/day], D [10 mg/day], and E [14 mg/day]). A decision to initiate Part B [5 mg/day of Lu 31-130], C [7 mg/day of Lu 31-130] or D [10 mg/day of Lu 31-130] will be based on safety and tolerability of the previous study part. Dependent on the safety, tolerability and PK data from Part D the study may proceed with Part E. The efficacy and the safety of Lu 31-130 will be evaluated in comparison to the pooled placebo group from all 5 study parts., Schizophrenia|Antipsychotic|Lu 31-130",2
"High Frequency rTMS Treatment for Cognitive Impairments in Chronic Schizophrenia Patients, OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the treatment of cognitive impairments in 120 chronic patients with schizophrenia.||METHODS:||Clinical Trial: The study consists of 8 weeks of treatment.|Assessment Procedures:||2.1 Primary Outcome Variable-Psychopathology: The psychopathology of patients was assessed by three clinical trained staff, who were blind to treatment protocols, using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Patients are interviewed at screening, at at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks.||2.2 Cognitive tests: RBANS was used to assess the cognitive function by three psychologists, which is comprised of a total score and 5 age-adjusted index scores for attention, language, delayed and immediate memory and visuospatial/construction. A translated and adapted Chinese version of RBANS has been evaluated for the test-retest reliability and clinical validity between schizophrenia patients and control subjects.

"A Safety and Effectiveness Study of Paliperidone Palmitate in Chinese Patients With Schizophrenia, This study is a single-group, open-label (name of study drug is known to patients), multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy/treatment response of paliperidone palmitate administered for 25 weeks as once-monthly injections to Chinese patients with schizophrenia who previously received treatment with oral antipsychotic medications. A target of 353 patients (inpatients or outpatients) with schizophrenia will be enrolled in the study and will receive injections of study drug (paliperidone palmitate) on Days 1 and 8, and thereafter at a monthly flexible dose, based on patients' tolerability and/or efficacy. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 1 week before treatment, a 25-week treatment period, and a follow-up period approximately 30 days after the last injection of study drug. Upon meeting the entry criteria for the study, patients will receive a total of 8 intramuscular (IM) injections of paliperidone palmitate during the treatment period as follows: 150 mg equivalent (eq) on Day 1, 100 mg eq on Day 8, and subsequent monthly IM injections with a flexible dose range of 75-150 mg eq. If the patient reports any signs or symptoms of worsening of schizophrenia, the investigator may prescribe a rescue medication (quick-relief or fast-acting medications that usually work right away to relieve symptoms) such as lorazepam (an antianxiety drug) to control agitation, irritability, restlessness, and hostility. Safety will be monitored throughout the study., Schizophrenia|Paliperidone|Safety|Effectiveness|Chinese",2
"Safety Study With Paliperidone ER Extended-Release (ER) Tablets in Geriatric Patients With Schizophrenia, Paliperidone is being developed as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia. The ER formulation of paliperidone was developed to deliver paliperidone at a relatively constant rate over a 24-hour period to improve the tolerability profile and decrease the potential for orthostatic hypotension. Typically, elderly persons with schizophrenia respond well to antipsychotic drugs. However, medications should be administered cautiously and usually at lower starting dosages than those prescribed for younger patients, with care taken to balance efficacy and tolerability. Flexible dosages of paliperidone ER have been chosen for this study to better achieve this balance and more closely mimic clinical practice. This is a multicenter, double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician will know if placebo or drug is being given and at what dose), randomized (patients will be assigned to different treatment groups based solely on chance), placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study. The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of flexible doses of paliperidone ER in patients with schizophrenia who are 65 years of age or older. The study consists of a screening phase of up to 5 days, a 6-week double-blind treatment phase, and an optional 24-week open-label treatment phase. For administrative purposes, the screening and the double-blind treatment phases are referred to as R076477-SCH-302 and the open-label treatment phase is named R076477-SCH-702. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive paliperidone ER or placebo. At the time patients enter the double-blind period, they must be hospitalized for a minimum of 14 full days. Those patients who receive paliperidone ER will start at a dosage of 6 mg taken daily, which may be titrated up to a maximum of 12 mg or down to a minimum of 3 mg daily based on the patient's safety and tolerability of the drug. Patients who complete the 6 weeks of double-blind treatment, or who finish at least 21 days of treatment and discontinue because of lack of efficacy, may enter the 24-week open label treatment phase. While patients are hospitalized, efficacy will be assessed twice during the first week and at the end of the second week. Efficacy will be evaluated throughout the 6-week double-blind phase by completion of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression Scale - Severity (CGI-S), Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP), Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale, Revision 4 (SQLS-R4), and Sleep Visual Analog Scale (VAS) during the double-blind treatment phase. The efficacy variable will be measured by the change from baseline score for PANSS, CGI S, SQLS-R4, Sleep VAS, and PSP. Safety will be monitored throughout the study based on incidence of adverse events; measurement of extrapyramidal symptoms using 3 rating scales (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale [AIMS], Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale [BARS], Simpson-Angus Rating Scale [SAS]); measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate); electrocardiograms; and clinical laboratory tests. Double-blind phase: paliperidone ER will be flexibly dosed in the range 3 to 12 mg (3, 6, 9, or 12 mg/day) orally once a day or matching placebo, for 6 weeks.||Open-label phase: The starting dose is 6 mg/day for 7 days; thereafter, flexible oral dosage of paliperidone ER (3, 6, 9, or 12 mg/day) for 24 weeks., schizophrenia|geriatric|elderly",2

This mean that approximately one third of the confirmed treatment-resistant patients were randomised back to the failed treatment used in the PC Period.||Data was not collected separately for the DBT Olanzapine and DBT Risperidone participants, and there was no intent to compare Lu AF35700 to each drug separately., 0",2
"Cerebral Impact of Cognitive Remediation for People Suffering From Schizophrenia, Among cognitive deficits associated to schizophrenia, the jumping to conclusion bias is a frequent consequence of the decision making process alteration. This bias is characterized by a fast decision making when probabilistic judgments would be necessar.||Cognitive remediation aims at reducing the impact of cognitive deficits. The program that will be used in the present study focuses on the jump to conclusion bias. In schizophrenia, the positive impact of programs targeting such a bias, and more generally social cognition, has already been shown in numerous studies. However, despite the fact that jumping to conclusion is one of the main goals of these programs, their effects on decision making are poorly investigated in literature.||The program should impact decision making and reduce the jumping to conclusion bias. The benefits will probably be linked with a change in the P300 signal. They will probably appear earlier and with bigger amplitudes., Schizophrenia|Cognitive remediation|Jumping to Conclusion",2

"Clinical Symptoms of Schizophrenia and Physical Exercise, Schizophrenia is a serious mental disease characterized by a combination of positive and negative symptoms, and it is associated with social and occupational dysfunction. The positive symptoms reflect an excess or distortion of normal functions (delusions, hallucinations and disorganized behavior), whereas the negative symptoms are related to flattened affect, alogia, avolition and decreased cognitive function. One recent study reported that schizophrenia is associated with distortions of reality, changes in perceptions and thoughts, difficulties in social situations and problems with daily functions.||Schizophrenia generally appears at the end of adolescence or at the beginning of adulthood and affects approximately 1% of the population. The disease has a deteriorating course and does not involve large neurological changes. Its etiology may be explained by interactions between factors associated with genetic susceptibility and adverse environmental factors. Recently, it has been hypothesized that alterations in neuroplasticity may be an important factor for the development of schizophrenia.||IGF-1 is an important growth factor that induces neuroplasticity (neuronal survival, cell differentiation, cell proliferation, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis). Schizophrenic patients have lower serum IGF-1 levels than healthy individuals. Because IGF-1 levels are lower in schizophrenic patients and this is associated with the etiology of the disease, it is important to investigate treatments that may increase serum IGF-1. Antipsychotic drugs such as olanzapine stimulate the phosphorylation of AKT, which is part of the main downstream pathway of IGF-1. It is possible to activate AKT through several intracellular signals and receptors, including activation of the insulin receptor (IR). However, activation of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) appears to be the main activator of AKT phosphorylation.||In addition to antipsychotic medications, resistance exercises may be another way to increase IGF-1 concentrations. This type of physical exercise has been growing in popularity in society. In recent years, evidence has shown benefits from this exercise for different age groups in both healthy and sick individuals, and it has been indicated to augment bone mineral mass, strength and muscular mass; to prevent or treat sarcopenia; to decrease frailty and functional impairment; and to improve cognitive function and hypertension, among other benefits.||Studies conducted with the young and the elderly who underwent resistance training have shown increased serum IGF-1 levels. However, studies showing the effects of resistance training and concurrent training on schizophrenia and serum IGF-1 levels have not been performed. Studying physical exercise is important for several reasons. Importantly, it is a low-cost treatment that may be a possible therapeutic tool, not only to increase IGF-1 concentrations but also to decrease disease symptoms, especially negative symptoms, and the side effects of antipsychotic drugs (extrapyramidal effects, weight gain and tiredness), which may improve quality of life. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of 20 weeks of resistance training and concurrent training on psychotic and depressive symptoms, quality of life and serum IGF-1 concentration., Physical exercise|Schizophrenia|symptoms|IGF-1",2

"EEG and Behavioral Correlates of Temporal Prediction in the Tactile Modality in Schizophrenia, Patients with schizophrenia have disturbances in their sense of self, particularly their bodily self. Disorders of the sense of self are central to schizophrenia and are of interest because they are thought to be present prior to the development of the disorder, when only a few attenuated symptoms signal a risk of developing psychosis. Finding markers related to the sense of self would make it possible to predict which subjects, among those with minimal psychotic symptoms, will develop psychosis, and thus to better adapt management. Disturbances in the experience of the passage of time that accompany disturbances in the sense of self have been described particularly in subjects at risk of developing psychosis, and would predict the onset of the pathology. However, as with alterations in the sense of self, it can be difficult to get patients to describe their disturbances in the experience of time, and objective measures are required to facilitate detection of these disturbances. In the present protocol an objective measure of temporal perception mechanisms will be tested in relation to the sense of self.||The tests used in the protocol assess subjects' abilities to benefit from the passage of time and to use these abilities to predict and prepare for the occurrence of an event. The investigators have previously shown that patients with impaired bodily sense of self do not benefit from the passage of time to prepare themselves to process information in the future. The present protocol is aimed at developing a measure more sensitive to the patients' disorders by adding tactile measures., 0",2

"Brain Imaging, Attention, and Auditory Processing in Schizophrenia, EEG recording: In this procedure, the researcher will assess the participant's brain function while performing simple computer-based tasks. The computer tasks involve presentation of pictures or sounds to which the participant responds by pressing a button. The investigators will also record some of the participant's own speech sounds and play them back to them. The participant will be given clear instructions and a chance to practice before each task. While you are performing these tasks, the investigator will record the weak electrical signals produced by your brain, or ""brain waves"", using a technique called electroencephalography (EEG). In order to record the participant's EEG, sensors (small plastic discs) will be attached to specific locations on their scalp. The participant's scalp will be gently scrubbed before the sensors are attached. The sensors are held in place on the scalp using a nylon cap that fits snugly on the head. Sensors will also be attached above and below the participant's eyes and will record their eye movements. It will take approximately one hour to attach the sensors. The entire EEG will take approximately 2-3 hours. Before taking part in the EEG session, please make sure to wash hair and scalp. Do not use conditioner or a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner. The participant's hair should be dry before arrival. The investigators ask this in order to make the set-up process go more smoothly.||During some tasks, participants will feel a vibratory sensation that is produced with an electrical current and it is possible that it may feel like a slight shock. The current is controlled and cannot reach levels that are painful or dangerous. Every participant experiences this sensation differently, so it is important that participants tell the researchers if the sensation becomes uncomfortable to you so the current can be adjusted or the task can be stopped.|Participants may be asked to complete additional EEGs for this study, depending on your interest in participating and your availability. All EEG sessions will last approximately 2 hrs.||MRI: In the fMRI procedure, we will use a magnet to measure blood flow to participants' brains while they do different tasks. Participants will be asked to lie down on a platform that can be slid into the middle of the magnet. A plastic MRI imaging coil will be placed around participants' heads. You will not come into contact with the coil during the experiment. Foam pads will be placed around the participant's head to limit head movement during the experiment. The investigators will then slide you into the magnet. At different points during the experiment, participants will be asked to do the same tasks they did in the training session prior to the scan. During the scan, participants will be asked to either lie still and rest, or do some tasks like tapping their fingers, remembering letters or digits, or viewing images that are designed to activate different parts of the brain. The entire MRI will take approximately two hours.||While performing the MRI, participants may be asked to wear a cap that contains multiple EEG sensors applied to your scalp. A removable gel will be used. The EEG measures electrical activity produced by the brain while participants undergo the MRI.

"Aripiprazole Augmentation for Clozapine-Treated Patients With Refractory Schizophrenia, Clozapine is renowned for its efficacy in treating schizophrenia refractory to typical or atypical antipsychotics. Though the effectiveness of clozapine has been established, a considerable number of patients with schizophrenia are partially responsive or unresponsive to clozapine. In addition, long-term use of clozapine is associated with the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and metabolic syndrome. In order to overcome these short-comings and to increase efficacy, aripiprazole augmentation was implemented. Quantitative electroencephalogram will be used to monitor the occurrence of abnormal findings and to analyze the changes in electroencephalographic pattern with linear and non-linear methodology.||Comparisons: Design of double-blind randomized placebo controlled study of patients at Refractory Schizophrenia Clinique in Department of Neuropsychiatry at Seoul National University Hospital., schizophrenia|aripiprazole|clozapine",2

"Paliperidone Palmitate Flexible Dosing in Schizophrenia, This study explores the tolerability, safety and treatment response of flexibly dosed paliperidone palmitate in approximately 1,000 patients with schizophrenia previously unsuccessfully treated with an oral or LAI antipsychotic medication. Non-acute and acute patients will be involved in the study. This study consists of a screening phase, a 6-month core treatment phase, and an optional extension phase. A transition period of preferably a maximum of 4 weeks will be allowed for the previous oral antipsychotic. When switching patients from previous LAI antipsychotics, paliperidone palmitate will be initiated in place of the next scheduled injection. Patients without source documentation of previous risperidone or paliperidone exposure must undergo oral tolerability testing with paliperidone ER (3 mg/day) for the 2 days prior to Baseline Visit. Patients who successfully complete the 6-month core treatment phase and would like to continue treatment with paliperidone palmitate may be enrolled in an optional extension phase until paliperidone palmitate is available in their respective country or until a maximum duration of 12 months after the last subject has completed the 6-month core treatment phase, whichever comes first. Patients will receive, without cost, paliperidone palmitate. Patients entering this optional extension phase, will receive once monthly injections with paliperidone palmitate. The recommended maintenance dose for these monthly injections is 75 mg eq. once monthly but flexible dosing in the range of 50 to 150 mg eq. once monthly will be allowed. The doctor may flexibly increase or decrease the dose preferably by one dosing level (within the range of 50 to 150 mg eq.) according to patients' clinical needs. During the extension phase, two types of visits can be distinguished: 'assessment visits' and 'treatment-only visits'. At each assessment visit (once every 3 months +/- 7 days), patients will receive their injection and will be questioned about adverse events (AEs). Body weight will also be assessed. Paliperidone palmitate will be given once monthly by injection in either the upper arm or buttocks muscle, but start every time with upper arm application.

"Psychosocial Therapy and Risperidone Treatment in Work Performance in Recent-Onset Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder. People with schizophrenia often experience hallucinations, delusions, thought disorders, and movement disorders. These symptoms make it difficult to maintain a job, participate in school, and keep up self-care. Proper treatment of first-episode schizophrenia may increase the chances of controlling disease progression on a long-term basis. Antipsychotic medications, such as risperidone, and psychosocial treatments, such as cognitive enhancement training and health behavior training, are common, effective treatments for schizophrenia. This study will determine the effectiveness of various combinations of psychosocial therapy and risperidone treatment in improving work or school performance in people with first-episode schizophrenia.||Participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following four combinations of an antipsychotic medication and a psychosocial treatment: cognitive enhancement training plus oral risperidone; cognitive enhancement training plus long-acting injectable risperidone; health behavior training plus oral risperidone; or health behavior training plus long-acting injectable risperidone. Cognitive enhancement training will entail 2 hours per week of computer-assisted training targeted at improving attention, memory, and problem-solving skills. Additionally, participants will attend a weekly 1-hour group meeting to learn how to apply these skills to work and school situations. Health behavior training will involve 3 hours per week of relaxation training, nutrition education, and physical exercise to enhance wellness. Participants assigned to receive oral risperidone will receive their medication in pill form at the dosage determined to be optimal by the study psychiatrist. Participants assigned to receive injectable risperidone will be given one injection every 2 weeks. Dosages will start at 25 mg per injection and will be adjusted as needed.||Treatment will continue for 1 year following dosage stabilization, which typically occurs 2 to 3 months following study entry. For the first 6 months, participants assigned to receive health behavior training will attend study visits once a week and participants assigned to receive cognitive enhancement training will attend study visits once a week. For the final 6 months, all participants will attend study visits twice weekly. At each visit, participants will receive their assigned psychosocial treatment; attend group therapy; meet with a case manager for counseling and assessment of symptoms, work functioning, and social functioning; and meet with a psychiatrist to monitor medication response.

"The Effects of tDCS on Illness Awareness in Schizophrenia, Transcranial DCS is a novel, non-invasive and non-convulsive technique for altering brain function. To our knowledge, no research has investigated the functional and behavioural effects of tDCS on anosognosia in schizophrenia. As such, we aim to improve impaired illness awareness in schizophrenia with tDCS by inhibiting left hemisphere regions (i.e. temporoparietooccipital cortex) shown by our group to be activated during illness denial.||Positive results will demonstrate that impaired illness awareness in schizophrenia involves a similar brain network to impaired illness awareness in patients with brain lesions and can be similarly modulated with non-invasive techniques, such as tDCS. If proven effective, this easy to administer, safe, non-invasive intervention would have the potential to alter individuals' attitude towards their illness and medication, leading ultimately to an improvement in individuals' capacity for illness recognition and treatment engagement, which would undoubtedly have a significant impact on the management of this devastating mental disorder., Magnetic resonance imaging|Anosognosia|Electrical stimulation of the brain",2

"Clinical Trial of Tolcapone for Cognition in Schizophrenia, Psychopharmacological modulation of the catecholaminergic system can enhance some aspects of cognitive function. For example, COMT inhibitors can slightly improve working memory/executive function. Differences in the response between individuals might be related to a number of factors, including variations in the genes. The recent finding that a polymorphism in the catechol-o-methyl-transferase (COMT) gene, which produces a 4 fold change in enzyme activity, accounts for 4 percent of the variance in performance of working memory tasks in humans suggest that COMT genotype may predict response to COMT inhibitors. In the present investigation our goal is to examine, in normal controls and patients with schizophrenia, the effect of a centrally acting (tolcapone) and of a peripherally acting (entacapone) COMT inhibitor on cognitive function. We predict that both normal controls and patients with schizophrenia with the val/val genotype will have a significant, though transient, improvement in working memory in subjects treated with tolcapone but not in those treated with entacapone. Furthermore, in conjunction with other NIMH imaging protocols, we would like to examine the neurophysiological correlates related to working memory. We predict, in tolcapone treated subjects, improved measures in prefrontal 'efficiency' in subjects and patients specifically with the val/val genotype. The present protocol will provide new insights on the importance of this genetic polymorphism in the regulation of aminergic-controlled cognitive function in normal individuals. Furthermore, this protocol will test whether COMT inhibitors offer a new treatment-based on genotype - for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.

"Long-acting Injectable Risperidone in Patients With Schizophrenia After an Acute Episode, Although many schizophrenia patients currently take oral antipsychotic medications, it is estimated that up to 75% of them have difficulty adhering to the daily oral regiment. Long-acting injectable formulations may eliminate the need for daily medication and enhance patient compliance with the treatment regimen. Traditionally, patients experiencing an episode of schizophrenia are first treated with oral medications until they are stabilized, and then injectable long-acting formulations are given. This is an open, multicenter, randomized Phase IV trial in patients after an acute episode of schizophrenia. Patients will be in the trial for 6 months. One treatment group will receive injections starting at baseline (early initiation); the other group will start with treatment as usual at baseline and begin injections at Week 12 (late initiation). Assessment of effectiveness include Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), in order to measure symptoms of schizophrenia; Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S), measuring overall severity of illness; Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), assessesing overall psychological, social, and occupational functioning; and Quality of Life Questionnaire SF-12, measuring overall health status. Safety evaluations include the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS), incidence of adverse events throughout the study, and vital signs (pulse, blood pressure).

"Schizophrenia, Related Troubles and Glutathione: Clinical Trial. Effects of Oral Administration of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) on the Brain Glutathione Level and on the Symptoms of Schizophrenia, The results of the study ""schizophrenia, related disorders and glutathione"" conducted at the Laboratory of Psychiatric Neuroscience (LUNEP) DUPA of Lausanne, reinforce the hypothesis proposed that a deficit intracerebral glutathione is a vulnerability factor for Schizophrenia at least for a subgroup of patients. While pursuing the baseline study, it is appropriate now to try to restore a higher level of glutathione in patients to see if this increase is accompanied by an improvement in symptoms, particularly negative symptoms and disorders cognitive, particularly resistant to current therapy. N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) is a precursor of glutathione which is used clinically for various indications, well tolerated even at high doses. The investigators propose a double-blind cross-over with the aim to study if the N-acetyl-cystein (at a dose of oral 2g/day) leads on the one hand a rising glutathione brain (measured in resonance magnetic spectroscopic) and also improved patients' conditions (determined by clinical assessments, psychopathological, neuropsychological, biochemical and physiological), while recording any side effects.

"Benefits of Physical Exercise in Schizophrenia, Difficulties in social integration pose a major mental health problem for Veterans with schizophrenia. Reviews of the literature indicate that Veterans with schizophrenia have lower marriage rates, fewer friendships, and higher rates of living alone than the general population. Poor social integration is also associated with early mortality. To gain traction on this problem, it will be necessary to find treatments that address key determinants of social integration. Evidence indicates that impairments in cognition and affect are among the key determinants of this area of functioning. Findings from the broader rehabilitation literature support a novel conceptual approach to this problem, namely engagement in physical exercise. Physical exercise is associated with improvements in attention, episodic memory, working memory, speed of processing, and executive control. In addition, physical exercise is associated with increases in positive affect and decreases in negative affect. Findings on the effects of physical exercise on cognition and affect have been reported for normal aging, mild cognitive impairment, neurodegenerative disorders, oncology, and depression, but is an area of investigation relatively new to schizophrenia. The proposed study will include 54 Veterans with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (aged 45-65) who will be matched on baseline levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, and then randomized (2:1) to a walking exercise group (n=36) or a control comparison group (n=18). Veterans in the exercise group will participate in a 12-week, instructor-led, outdoor brisk walking exercise program conducted in small groups (n=6), held 3 times per week, gradually increasing walking time until reaching a maximum of 40-minutes per session. The heart rate of each Veteran will be monitored during the walking sessions to help ensure maintenance of a target peak heart rate of 60% to 70% of the maximum for the individual's age (i.e., 220-age). Veterans in the control group will participate in instructor-led, non-aerobic stretching exercises in small groups (n=6) with the duration, frequency, and total number of sessions matched to the exercise group. Primary outcome measures of cardiorespiratory fitness, cognition, and positive and negative affect of participants in both groups will be measured at baseline and the 12-week end-point assessment., 0",2
"Evaluation of a Cognitive Adaptive E-treatment in Schizophrenia-diagnosed Adults, The symptoms of schizophrenia fall into three main categories: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive symptoms. Each category represents distinct functional challenges and impedes patient productivity and overall quality of life.||Cognitive symptoms are pervasive and result in deficits in executive functioning (the ability to understand information and use it to make decisions), attention (the ability to identify, select, and focus on relevant sensory events), and working memory (the ability to hold information in memory and then guide actions from it). These symptoms impair patients' abilities to successfully perform everyday activities, including independent living, employment, and social relationships, and in addition can cause great emotional distress.||Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia has now received substantial academic study, with over 24,000 research papers published in the field since 1990. This enormous body of work has shown that cognitive impairment is likely to be present in virtually all patients with schizophrenia, regardless of their severity of illness or treatment status. People with schizophrenia typically perform 1-2 standard deviations below the mean of age-matched controls (indicating substantial impairment) across the domains of speed of information processing, attention, working memory, verbal and visual learning, reasoning and social cognition.||While cognitive impairment in schizophrenia was originally assumed to be secondary to positive or negative symptoms of the disorder, or related to the use of anti-psychotic medications, recent research has conclusively shown that neither of these past assumptions is true. For example, the landmark Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) trial involving 1,493 participants demonstrated that negative symptoms are only mildly correlated with cognitive function, and that positive symptoms are completely uncorrelated with cognitive function. Furthermore, research has shown that cognitive impairment is evident in people with schizophrenia before they are medicated, prior to diagnosis, and in first-degree relatives of people diagnosed with schizophrenia; indicating that medication is not the cause of cognitive impairment. In aggregate, these data have established the well-accepted current viewpoint that cognitive dysfunction is a core primary symptom and deficit in schizophrenia., Schizophrenia|Cognitive deficits|Cognitive remediation|Software|Brain Plasticity",2

"Trial of Treatment for Internalized Stigma in Schizophrenia, Internalized (or self) stigma develops when people with mental illness become aware of stigmatizing attitudes held by many in society about mental illness (e.g., dangerousness, incompetence, inability to work), perceive these attitudes as being legitimate, and apply them to themselves. There is substantial evidence that internalized stigma is strongly negatively linked to both the objective (e.g., social functioning) and subjective (e.g., self-esteem and well-being) components of recovery for persons with schizophrenia, and that these effects operate independent of symptom-related disability. Nevertheless, few efforts have been made to develop treatment to address this issue. Previously, the investigators were funded to develop a group-based intervention (R34MH082161) combining cognitive-behavioral therapy and narrative psychotherapy to address internalized stigma among people with severe mental illness. The purpose of the present study is to build upon the investigators' previous exploratory intervention development study by conducting an adequately-powered, randomized controlled trial of the Narrative Enhancement/Cognitive Therapy (NECT) intervention among persons with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The investigators will screen 500 persons at two sites (Newark, New Jersey and Indianapolis, IN) for evidence of moderate or elevated internalized stigma. They will conduct a randomized study of NECT versus supportive group therapy in a sample of 175 individuals meeting Structured Clinical Interview criteria for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Randomization will be stratified by baseline self-stigma severity (moderate or elevated), to ensure roughly equal numbers of participants for each stratum. Participants will complete baseline, post-treatment, 3-month post treatment and 6-month post treatment assessments of internalized stigma, psychiatric symptoms, insight, self-esteem, hopelessness, coping, narrative coherence and social functioning. The specific aims of the project are: 1) Conduct a randomized study of the effectiveness of NECT, comparing outcomes for 175 persons with schizophrenia-spectrum disorder randomly assigned to NECT or supportive group therapy, 2) Examine the mediating impact of changes in narrative coherence and in the use of problem-centered coping strategies on outcomes for persons assigned to the NECT treatment. The intervention can have important implications for enhancing usual care services to reduce disability for people with schizophrenia, and therefore has potentially important implications for improving the public health., 0",2
"Effects of Cognitive Remediation Therapy on Schizophrenia Patients Through Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, A controlled randomized study will be carry out with three different groups: patients receiving cognitive rehabilitation treatment (CRT), patients receiving another psychological intervention of control and a healthy control group. A descriptive study of cases will be also carried out. The functional MRI (fRMI) techniques as well as voxel-based morphometry allow individual analysis of cases.||The independent variable is the cognitive rehabilitation treatment. The CRT will be applied according to the manual of Wykes & Reeder (2005) Cognitive Remediation Therapy: Theory and Practice, Ed: Routledge. The program has a duration of 40 sessions (one hour of duration), with two sessions for week during four months. It is carried out individually and utilizes paper and pencil tasks. The main technique utilized is the scaffolding (to provide strategies when the patient cannot carry out the task and to withdraw him when he is yet able of doing it alone) in a context of learning without errors.||The main dependent variable is the functional connectivity cerebral pattern obtained by means of functional magnetic resonance. Other secondary dependent variables are neurocognitive functioning, the symptomatic pattern and the psychosocial functioning obtained from the psychometric evaluation.||All the participants will be evaluated before and after the experimental intervention in neurocognitive areas (Battery will be composed by WAIS-III, RAVLT, Trail Making Test, STROOP color word, WCST, FAS-COWAT), symptomatic area (PANSS) and in social functioning (Social Functioning Scale SFS; Birchwood et al. 1990).

"Cognitive Enhancement Therapy for Early-Stage Schizophrenia, In this study, we wish to determine the neurobiological predictors and the relative efficacy of Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET) in ameliorating specific cognitive abnormalities presumably mediated by PFC and related brain structures, among younger, early-course schizophrenia patients who potentially have a better prognosis. A series of recent-onset schizophrenic patients, whose psychotic symptoms have successfully been stabilized on an atypical antipsychotic drug for one year following initiation of treatment, will be randomized to CET combined with an enriched supportive therapy (EST) or EST alone, and treated for two years. Subjects will have been assessed on neurobehavioral and clinical indices immediately prior to beginning CET or EST (corresponding with the CNMD 1-year follow-up) and in the proposed study will again be assessed after 1 and 2 years of psychosocial treatment. In a smaller subset of patients, we will also seek to collect preliminary data on the efficacy of CET in reversing the neurobiological alterations in the PFC. The hypotheses of this study are:||The presence of relatively well preserved PFC structure and function (PFC volume, activation with fMRI, and metabolism as measured by proton MRS) at baseline will predict a better response to CET (Neurobiological Prediction Hypothesis).|CET combined with ""enriched"" supportive psychotherapy (EST) will be more effective than EST alone in ameliorating social and non-social cognitive deficits of patients with early schizophrenic illness whose psychotic symptoms have been stabilized on maintenance chemotherapy (The Treatment Efficacy Hypothesis).|CET will result in additive, positive effects on neurocognitive parameters that were not observed following one year of antipsychotic medication, using a ""sequential"" treatment design in a subset of patients in whom we have pre-neuroleptic baseline data from CNMD studies (The Treatment Specificity Hypothesis).||Study Design: Subjects will be randomly assigned, once stabilized clinically, to CET plus EST (n = 30) or EST alone (n = 30) and then treated for up to two years. Clinical, neuropsychological, neurological and functional neuroimaging assessments will be administered at baseline and at two annual follow-ups. At the end of CET or EST treatment, subjects will be asked to come back quarterly to meet informally with either their Cognitive Enhancement Therapy clinicians and former group members, or with their Enriched Supportive Therapy clinician. The purpose of these visits is for us to learn more about the successes that patients have had, or about the difficulties that they might have had since leaving the program. Clinician(s) will also share information obtained during this follow-up which might help patient in overcoming these difficulties.

"Peer-led Psycho-education for Schizophrenia, Objectives: This study is to test the effectiveness of a peer-expert-led psycho-education group programme for Chinese outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders over an 24-month follow-up. The program is an integrated,psycho-education program that addresses patients' knowledge and self-management of schizophrenia and problem-solving skills. Methods: A single-blind, multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 342 Chinese patients with schizophrenia in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan. In each of three study sites, the participants will be randomly selected from the eligible patient list (i.e., 114 subjects from each study site) and after baseline measurement, be assigned to either the peer-led psycho-education program, profession-led psycho-education group, or usual psychiatric care. The patients' mental and psychosocial functioning, insights into illness, and their re-hospitalization rates will be measured at recruitment and at one week, and 6, 12 and 24 months after completing the interventions. Hypothesis: The patients in the peer-led psycho-education program will report significantly greater improvements in their symptoms and re-hospitalisation rates (primary outcomes) and other secondary outcomes (e.g., insight into illness and functioning) over the 24-month follow-up, when compared with those in profession-led psycho-education group and/or usual care. Conclusions: The findings will provide evidence whether the peer-led psycho-education group program can better improve Chinese schizophrenia sufferers' psychosocial functioning and reduce their illness relapse., peer expert or specialist|psycho-education|schizophrenia|outpatients",2
"High-Definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation as a Treatment of Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders that almost 1% worldwide population suffer from this devastating illness. The clinical expression of this illness has been categorized into different dimensions, though most of the patients are well treated with antipsychotic medication, the negative symptom is still one of the very refractory symptoms. Emerging evidence shows that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising treatment for schizophrenia negative symptoms, however, findings are still controversial. HD-tDCS can provide a more stable and accurate direct current comparing with traditional tDCS, which gives a hope to treat negative symptoms in a more reliable way.||An association between negative symptoms and grey matter reductions in the prefrontal cortex is found, moreover, even during rest, hypoactivity of the prefrontal cortex, particularly of the left dorsolateral, and of the anterior cingulate regions, has been linked to negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It has been observed that tDCS could relatively alleviate negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia by stimulating the left DLPFC through an anodal electrode, which has been proved can also modulate brain functional connectivity and have clinical improvements.||Half of the participants with a clinical presentation of predominant negative symptoms will be stimulated by active HD-tDCS and the rest will have a sham stimulation. HD-tDCS is going to be delivered at 1.5 mA intensity for 20 minutes once a day; sessions will be performed on 10 days 5 consecutive weekdays with sustained effects at 1 (T2) and 3 (T3) months. A Soterix Medical 4x1 HD-tDCS will be used with the anode placed over the left DLPFC (F3), surrounded by four cathodal electrodes at F5, F1, FC3 and AF3, based on the 10/20 international EEG system. All the outcomes will be assessed at baseline (T0, before HD-tDCS sessions), one day after the 10th HD-tDCS sessions (T1), and also at T2 and T3.

"Endocannabinoid Control of Microglia Activation as a New Therapeutic Target in the Treatment of Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder with an urgent need for new and more effective treatments. A promising novel pharmacological target in this respect is the endocannabinoid system. In particular the cannabinoid compound cannabidiol (CBD) displays a highly favourable profile for development as a new antipsychotic agent. Increasing evidence indicates a significant role for neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, especially for activation of resident macrophages of the brain: microglia. Interestingly, converging preclinical evidence suggests that microglia activation is under control of the endocannabinoid system. However, how manipulation of the endocannabinoid system affects microglia activation in humans has not been established, but it is presumably related to clinical improvement of schizophrenia patients.||In this project, we propose to study endocannabinoid control of microglia activation as a new therapeutic target in the treatment of schizophrenia. Using a placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind design, we will investigate this in a group of 36 recent-onset schizophrenia patients after four weeks of daily CBD treatment, in addition to their regular antipsychotic medication. First, we will examine if CBD treatment attenuates microglia activation and levels of peripheral inflammatory markers. In vivo microglia activation is assessed before and after treatment using 1H-MRS, with the level of myo-inositol being regarded as a marker of glia function. Second, we will determine if reduced microglia activation and levels of inflammatory markers relate to improvement of symptomatology and cognitive function. Third, we will assess how microglia activation and levels of inflammatory markers before treatment predict the clinical response to CBD., Schizophrenia|Cannabidiol|Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS)|Microglia",2

"An Open-label Study Evaluating the Maintenance of Clinical Effect in Adult Schizophrenia Patients Switched From Risperidone Tablets to an Equivalent Dose of a Rapidly-dissolving Tablet Formulation of Risperdone, This trial is a non-randomized, open-label, single arm, multicentre study aimed at evaluating the maintenance of clinical effect of the rapidly-dissolving tablet dosage form of risperidone, in patients switched from their previous equivalent dose of conventional risperidone tablets (doses of 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg or 4 mg/day). Approximately 100 adult schizophrenia patients (ages >= 18 years) who are symptomatically stable will be enrolled. Patients will be asked to take an equivalent dose of the rapidly-dissolving tablet form of risperidone for 4 weeks of treatment. Other psychotropic medications taken at study entry may be continued throughout the study, providing the dose was stable prior to entry for a minimum of 4 weeks and will remain stable throughout the course of the study. Dose escalation/reduction of rapidly-dissolving risperidone tablets is not permitted. Study visits will take place twice over the 4 week period, once at study entry and again at the final visit. The primary efficacy parameter will be the CGI-Severity (CGI-S) score for maintenance of clinical effect. Secondarily, two 5-point Likert scales will be completed, one measuring clinician's assessment of anxiety symptoms and the other measuring clinician's assessment of depressive symptoms. Patients with existing symptoms of psychosis will be clinician rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Other secondary assessments include: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for risperidone acceptability, completed by the patient or the caregiver (if applicable). For each subject, the VAS score will be calculated on a 10 cm line ranging from a score of ""0"" (not acceptable) to ""10"" (very acceptable). Safety evaluations during the study will include vital signs and physical examination, body weight, adverse event surveillance, and urine pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential. The study hypothesis is that the clinical effect will be maintained when schizophrenia patients previously stabilized on risperidone conventional tablets are treated with rapidly-dissolving risperidone tablets, and that risperidone rapidly dissolving tablets will be well tolerated.||Subjects who are stable on conventional risperidone tablets (0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/day) for at least 2 weeks will be switched to an equivalent dose of rapidly-dissolving risperidone tablets (0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/day).

"Neurobiological and Neurocognitive Disturbances in First-episode Schizophrenia, Patients and matched healthy controls are examined at baseline and again after the patients have been treated for 6 months with a combined 5-HT2A- and dopamine D2- receptor blocker. We have chosen the atypical antipsychotic compound, quetiapine, for the present study since this drug is characterized by a fast koff/low affinity for the dopamine D2 receptors. The purpose of the study is to examine pathophysiological and neuropsychological mechanisms - not treatment effects. We want to characterize neurobiological and functional endophenotypes or vulnerability indicators and to study their stability over time and their relation to treatment and contemporary psychopathology. To the extent that candidate endophenotypes can be characterized as stable and independent of treatment and contemporary psychopathology they will be analysed together with similar findings from previous (identical)cohorts of schizophrenic patients.

"A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Seroquel in Chinese Han Patients With Schizophrenia, This is a rater- blind, parallel assignment, randomized and active controlled study. The subjects investigated are outpatients or inpatient with schizophrenia from the Chinese Han race. The screening phase lasts for 1 week. The eligible patients enter the next randomized treatment phase. The titration duration is 1 week. After the first week, the patients are administered with a flexible dose regimen. In this study, the effective doses range of seroquel and risperidone are 600-750mg/d and 3-6mg/d respectively and the treatment duration lasts for 6 weeks.||The efficacy and safety of seroquel in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia have been confirmed by multiple double blind studies. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of seroquel in the treatment of Chinese Han patients with schizophrenia. Therefore, the single blind and active control design should be selected for this study. The drug titration method and dose are within the range specified in the instruction and patients with schizophrenia are tolerant to the drug in clinical treatment.||The purpose of schizophrenic patient treatment is to improve the core symptoms, prevent suicide and other aggressive behavior, alleviate the side reactions caused by the drug, and recover the life functions of patients. Generally, the treatment in the acute phase lasts for 6 to 8 weeks. In this study, the treatment in the acute phase lasts for 6 weeks.||The rating scales used in this study are standard psychiatric rating scales with good validity and are widely used in the study of antischizophrenia drugs and in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia in China. The PANSS is developed from two early rating scales, namely the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) and the psychiatric rating scale. The high inter-investigator reliability and repeated measurement reliability of these scales have been proved by multiple studies. The clinical global impression (CGI) is a simple but convenient global impression scale. It is applicable to any patients treated and studied by the psychiatric department. The Carlgary depression scale for schizophrenia (CDSS) is used to evaluate the depressive symptoms of patients with schizophrenia. It has good reliability and validity. The abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS) is another evaluation tool consisting of 12 items. The AIMS is used to evaluate the abnormal involuntary movements related to antischizophrenia drugs. The AIMS is nearly the most frequently used multi-item rating scale evaluating of tardive dyskinesia. The Simpson and Angus scale (SAS) is also a rating scale commonly used since its release in 1970.

"Can we Forget? Directed Forgetting and Embodied Cognition in Schizophrenia, Researchers used the directed forgetting paradigm composed of two lists of action verbs. The instruction ""to forget"" is given at the end of learning the first list (To Be Forgotten (TBF)), following a simulation of a computer bug. Therefore a second list is presented to be learned and remembered (To Be Remembered (TBR)). A recognition task is performed at the end. The action verbs had to be encoded using four conditions: action performed, mimed, imagined action, action with a contextual word, reading the action verb only. 48 schizophrenic patients were included in this study. Patients were randomized to have 10 participants per condition. 48 controls matched by age, gender, laterality and education are also included and randomized in the same modality.

"Molecular Genetic Study of Schizophrenia: Parent-Offspring Trios, Specific Aims We propose to collect genomic DNA and lymphoblast cell lines of a total of 150 families with the probands fulfilling the criteria of DSM-IV schizophrenia in three years. The first degree relatives of the probands, including parents (parent-offspring trios) and non-affected siblings, a total of about 3 to 6 subjects, will also be recruited in study. Adequate statistical power of molecular genetic studies is the great concern. For this concern, we will examine the probands and family members clinically by using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) for diagnostic assessment, and using neuropsychological battery including sustain attention, executive function, verbal memory and general intelligence.||This specific aims of this project are: (1) to cooperate with this important Taiwan Genotyping Consortium proposed by the NHRI; (2) to detect major schizophrenia susceptibility genes which are related to the neuropsychological endophenotype; (3) to do further fine mapping on suggestive linkage chromosome regions to replicate previous linkage studies results using our previously-collected co-affected sib-pair family sample; and (4) to deposit the lymphoblast cell lines into NHRI Cell Bank serving as a national resource for basic research in Taiwan.||Background||1. Genetic Basis of Schizophrenia Most family studies confirm that schizophrenia and related disorders is a familial disorder and that the risk to first degree relatives of schizophrenic patients is approximately ten times the risk to relatives of controls. Twin studies have found concordance rates from 46%~53% for MZ twin pairs, and from 14%~15% for DZ twin pairs (Kendler KS 1983; Gottesman II 1993; Prescott and Gottesman II, 1993); thus provide strong evidence for an hereditary component to schizophrenia. However, the concordance rates in MZ twins is far from 100% , which also emphasizes the importance of environmental factors in the etiology of schizophrenia. The evidence of genetic contribution to the etiology of schizophrenia is further supported by adoption study. Adoption studies of schizophrenia have shown that when biological offspring of schizophrenic mothers were raised by adoptive parents, they showed higher rates of schizophrenia as adults, compared to control adoptees.||Segregation analyses indicate that multifactorial polygenic model, which posit a large, unspecified number of loci to combine additively in causing schizophrenia, better fit the observed patterns of schizophrenia in family studies than do single major locus model. It was suggested that several genes of small effect in epistasis might responsible for genetic etiology of schizophrenia.||The location of susceptibility gene of schizophrenia is still under active search using molecular genetic methods. This way of approach included linkage analysis, candidate genes association study, and positional candidate gene approach, there is no a priori hypothesis that would lead one to focus on any given chromosomal region. Thus, the whole genome needs to be systemically screened. A few genome-wide scans of schizophrenia have been published for the decade and many chromosome regions showed suggestive evidences for linkage, including chromosome 1q21-q22, 1q31-q42, 2p22-q21, 4q24-q32, 6p24-p22, 6q16-q23, 8p24-p21, 10p14-p13, 13q14-q32, 15q13-q14, 22q11-q13. However, only a few chromosome regions were ever reported to have genome-wide significant linkage evidences, including chromosome 1q21-q22, 6p24-p22, 8p21 and 13q32.||Candidate genes studies revealed inconsistent results in the past decade. Neurotransmitter related genes, such as dopamine (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5), serotonin, r-aminobutyric acid and Glutamate receptor genes had been studied using both association and linkage studies and no consistent results obtained. Neuron growth related genes, phospholipase genes, and a potassium channel gene (hKCa3/KCNN3) have been reported association with schizophrenia. The hypothesis about the pathophysiological mechanism of schizophrenia provide the probable candidate genes approach in the molecular genetic study. There exists two issues to be resolved for candidate gene approach using case-control design. Firstly, a critical issue in assessing the significance of association with phenotypic measures is the likelihood of type I errors. Since many genes and phenotypes can be evaluated for schizophrenia, the significance level needs to be adjusted due to the low prior probability and multiple testing. Secondly, the effects of different population admixture between cases and controls may inflate the type I errors Positional candidate gene approach using linkage dysequilibrium strategy may resolve the above two problems raised by the approach of candidate gene association study basing upon the previous linkage results to increase the prior probability and using parent-offspring trios as internal control. This approach is more powerful than linkage study to locate the susceptibility genes of complex disorder as schizophrenia. With the fine mapping linkage evidences, the whole genome sequence and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map, and the advancing microarray technique available, this approach is more efficient to locate the susceptibility genes of schizophrenia. Recently, a study using above strategy has been reported significant linkage dysequilibrium evidence of schizophrenia to a microsatellite polymorphism and a SNP of a gene, NOTCH4 gene, at chromosome 6p21.||Considering the potentials of positional candidate gene approach using linkage dysequilibrium strategies, we propose to collect parent-offspring trios of schizophrenia as the sample of further molecular genetic study of schizophrenia. With our previous and ongoing efforts in linkage studies of schizophrenia using co-affected sib-pairs of schizophrenia (see preliminary results), this sample can be used for further positional candidate gene studies.||3. Neuropsychological Deficit in Schizophrenia In the domain of neuropsychology, schizophrenia have been shown to have unique pattern of impairments in central executive function, sustained attention and working memory were rather unique in schizophrenia and are suggestive of frontostriatal dysfunction. It was agreed by most researchers that neuropsychological impairments of schizophrenia were best demonstrated by comprehensive test batteries tapping on various neuropsychological process, rather than single, isolated test and at present, the impairments strongly suggested dysfunction of frontal-temporal-limbic circuit.||Among the neuropsychological deficits in schizophrenia, visual sustained attention measured by the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and executive function measured by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) were studied more thoroughly. Common features of the CPT are that participants must respond to predesignated targets among stimuli that are presented at a rapid fixed rate. The discrimination vigilance task of the CPT may consist of a single stimulus (CPT-X, single character or number as the target ) or two successive stimuli (CPT-AX, a character or number preceded by another character or number as the target). The difficulty level of the CPT can be raised further by blurring the stimuli (degraded CPT) or using a relative target (CPT-Identical Pairs Version or CPT-IP). The different CPT versions might tap on different components of sustained attention: the more difficult ones are stable vulnerability indicators, while the simpler ones might be mediating vulnerability indicators in schizophrenia. Among studies specifically examining the relationships between CPT performance indexes and clinical symptom dimensions, one of the most consistent findings is that CPT deficits are associated with negative symptoms. Many studies also found that poorer performance on the CPT were associated with thought disorder or disorganized symptoms.||Executive function deficits measured by WCST referred to abnormal function of prefrontal cortex. Deficits in WCST performance are enduring and core features of schizophrenia, and predict long term disability, independent of other cognitive deficits. Functional neuroimaging studies have found that the WCST activates the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and that the dopamimetic drugs improves performance on this task in patients with schizophrenia and enhance the signal to noise of the prefrontal physiological response.||Previous studies confirmed that deficits in sustained attention and executive function are specific to schizophrenia and related to schizophrenic pathophysiological process. The deficits have also been associated with genetic risk of schizophrenia and may serve as an endophenotype in genetic analysis in schizophrenia.||4. Endophenotype Approach in Molecular Genetic Studies of Schizophrenia To resolve the problems of insufficient power of genetic analyses and genetic heterogeneity of schizophrenia, an alternative strategy was advocated that the use of a specific neurobiological characteristic of the illness as an additional phenotype that might reflect more closely the effect of a single genetic alteration.||The visual sustained attention deficits as measured by CPT was an potential endophenotype of the genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia. CPT deficits were present not only in schizophrenia patients, but also in their non-psychotic relatives. Using data from 148 non-psychotic relatives and 345 community adults found that the recurrence risk ratio λwas greater than 15 for the undegraded CPT and greater than 30 for the degraded CPT.||The executive function deficits as measured by WCST may also serve as an endophenotype in genetic studies of schizophrenia. WCST deficits presented both in schizophrenic patients and their healthy siblings.||Thus, using CPT deficits and WCST deficits as endophenotypes of schizophrenia would provide a valuable measure of genetic risk, would improve the power of genetic analyses and may help identify susceptibility genes for schizophrenia.||This endophenotype strategy has been successful in mapping of a neurophysiological deficit of schizophrenia, decrease of P50 inhibition, to loci at chromosome 15q13-14, recently. The genome-wide linkage analysis of the P50 inhibition deficit in nine multiplex schizophrenia families found a significant lod score (Z = 5.30,  = 0) at a loci chromosome 15q14. When the clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia was used as the affected phenotype, the maximum lod score at the same marker was not statistically significant. The other neurobiological deficit, eye tracking dysfunction of schizophrenia has been mapped to chromosome 6p23-21 with the maximum multipoint lod score of 4.02. Again, while the clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia was used as the affected phenotype, the linkage result was non-significant.||In summary, with our preliminary studies in linkage analyses using co-affected sib-pairs of schizophrenia and neuropsychological deficits in schizophrenia, this project to collect schizophrenics of parent-offspring trios with well-defined neuropsychological endophenotypes, is considered to be one crucial project for searching the susceptibility genes of schizophrenia.||Preliminary Studies||Collection of Schizophrenia Co-affected Sibpairs Family The P.I. has been committed himself in collecting the schizophrenia co-affected sib-pairs family since 1990. With the awareness of the importance and critical necessity of diagnostic assessment, these probands, co-affected sib and available non-affected sib as well as the parents were assessed with a semi-structured psychiatrist diagnostic interview using diagnostic criteria of DSM-III-R and/or DSM-IV. Besides, under the evolutionary theoretical model of psychopathology, developmental data were also collected. All these clinical data and family-tree data were established in the data bank of the molecular genetic laboratory (DBMGL) in the Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University under the auspice of the P.I. In total, there are around 120 schizophrenia co-affected sib-pairs families available for linkage analysis in the DBMGL. As a rule, the DNA samples were obtained from the peripheral white cells of all available subjects of the family, especially the co-affected sibs, at least one non-affected sib and the parents. In total, around 1000 DNA samples were in the DBMGL. Cell-lines of EBV-958 transformed lymphoblast cells were established too. All these study subjects were well informed for this study and informed consent obtained. All families participated in this study were invited to join a ""New-Hope Family Club"" for periodic meeting and discussion. Around 150 schizophrenia cases who received detail clinical assessment and regular follow-up and comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, including CPT, WCST, WAIS-R, and WMS, were recruited for obtaining DNA samples. Around 200 normal control subjects were also recruited for obtaining DNA samples.||The instruments used in genetic studies have been established. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Genetic Study (DIGS) and schizotypy interview schedule (SIS) were translated and modified to be useful in Taiwan subjects. The Perceptual aberration scale (PAS) and Schizotypal personality questionnaire (SPQ) were also used in community study on schizophrenia-related personality disorders. The cross-cultural consideration was employed.||A 5-year nation-wide collaborative work in Taiwan (Taiwan Schizophrenia Linkage Study, TSLS), sponsored by the NIMH, U.S.A., to collect families with co-affected sib-pairs with schizophrenia has been going on in the third years. A total of 600 families will be collected. DNA samples, cell-lines and clinical data of DIGS, FIGS, as well as neuropsychological testing data were collected. The DNA sample would be open to research teams all over the world.||Molecular Genetic Studies of Schizophrenia Our molecular genetic studies of schizophrenia were supported by three consecutive projects: the molecular genetic project sponsored by the National Science Council (1989-1992), the molecular genetic project of MPGRP (1993-1998) and the molecular genetic project of MPSS (1998-2001) sponsored by NHRI. The early phase (1989-1992) of this molecular genetic project focused on establishing laboratory facilities and collecting co-affected schizophrenic sib-pair families. The 2nd phase of this molecular genetic project (1993-1998) continued the collection of families, and the collection was extended to collect the co-affected bipolar sib-pairs, schizophrenic cases and normal controls. We found the polymorphism of androgen receptor gene of (CAG)n had a probable association with schizophrenia. This finding supported the finding of DeLisi et al. The molecular genetic methods of linkage analysis and candidate gene association were promoted, this laboratory of the P.I. (Dr. Hwu) moved to emphasize in this area too. The results of this laboratory were: (1) The polymorphism of (48bp) repeats in DRD4 receptor gene was not significantly linked with schizophrenia; (2) A single mutation in DRD2 was found not to be associated with schizophrenia (3) The samples of the data bank of this project had joined three international collaboration studies using positional cloning approach which need relatively large sample. The one is organized by Gill et al entitled as ""Schizophrenia Collaborative Linkage Group"", another was led by Dr. Moises in Kiel University, Germany and the third one is with Dr. Powell in London. All these results revealed the possible markers in chromosomes 6p, 11q, 13q, 19q and 22q. This suggests that Taiwanese patients may have possible susceptibility genes in these regions, except chromosome 13q, fitting an oligogenetic model. (4) The association study on 5-HT2 receptor gene located on chromosome 13q was found to be negative; (5) Clinical epidemiological analysis using co-affected sib-pairs demonstrated the tendency of 3 independent symptom clusters of reality disorganization, disorganization and negative state. (6) Weak linkage evidence to loci at chromosome 6p24-22.||The 3rd phase of the molecular genetic study (1998-2001) continued focusing at collecting co-affected schizophrenic sib-pair families and linkage analysis on reported suggestive evidences of chromosome regions, including chromosome 1q21-q22, 1q31-q42, 8p24-p21, 15q13-q14, 22q11-q14. The linkage results were (1) suggestive evidence of linkage for schizophrenia with and without the negative symptoms on chromosome 6p24 and 22q12 (2) no linkage evidence of GABAA receptor α1 (GABRA1) , β1 (GABRB1) andβ3 (GABAB3) subunit gene with schizophrenia (3) no linkage evidence of Glutamate GluR5 and GluR6 receptor gene with schizophrenia (4) no linkage evidence of SCA1 gene with schizophrenia (5) suggestive linkage evidence on markers of chromosome 8p with schizophrenia (Hwu et al., 2001a) (6) weak linkage evidence of markers of chromosome 1q31-42 with schizophrenia (7) suggestive linkage evidence of markers on 15q13-14 with schizophrenia (8) modest linkage evidence of schizophrenia to loci at chromosome 1q21-22. The candidate gene approach has revealed the following results: (1) possible association between Dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) gene polymorphism with quick treatment response of schizophrenia (Liu et al., 2001d) . (2) no association between cytosolic phospholipase A2 (c-PLA2) gene polymorphism and schizophrenia.||Studies on Neuropsychological Deficits in Schizophrenia We found impaired sustained attention by continuous performance test (CPT) as the trait marker of schizophrenia. Family studies have indicated that sustained attention deficits as measured by the CPT are vulnerability markers of schizophrenia. The results are: (1) a substantial proportion of non-psychotic relatives of schizophrenia probands (19-34%) have CPT deficits, which can be predicted from their probands' CPT performance; (2) subjects with schizotypal personality features also exhibit CPT deficits, which are specifically associated with negative factors of schizotypy; (3) CPT deficits are present in schizophrenic patients, are particularly associated with negative and disorganized symptoms, and those with more difficult CPT versions are not amenable to neuroleptic treatment.||The specificity of CPT was studied in a group of schizophrenia patients (n=41) in contrast to the group of bipolar patients with psychotic symptoms (n=46) and the group of bipolar patients without psychotic symptoms (n=22) and a group of patients with non-psychotic major depressive disorder (n=22). It was found that CPT deficits are stable vulnerable indicators of schizophrenia, mediating vulnerability indicators for bipolar disorder, and state-dependent indicator for major depression. These results demonstrate that CPT deficits are valid trait marker of schizophrenia.||All these preliminary data support that the PI and his associates is capable in executing this project including collection of parent-offspring trios families, DNA extraction and cell culture laboratory techniques, and the neuropsychological assessment.||Research Design and Methods||1. Subjects We prepare to collect parent-offspring trios families from the Medical Center of National Taiwan University Hospital and the affiliated psychiatric hospitals, the Taoyuan Psychiatric Center. The proband cases to be recruited are the residents of the Northern part of Taiwan. Informed consent will be obtained before the recruitment for study. The first degree relatives to be recruited are the parents and at least one of the unaffected siblings. The diagnosis of the proband cases is of schizophrenia defined by DSM-IV criteria.||Clinical Assessment Measures I. The Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) All subjects will be personally interviewed with the DIGS, which was created by Tsuang and Faraone from the NIMH Human Genetics Initiative. The DIGS makes a detailed assessment of the course of illness, and makes a careful assessment of substance abuse and mood symptoms. This allows for an easier differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and substance related psychoses, schizoaffective disorders and psychotic mood disorders. This detailed assessment helps protect against false positive diagnosis.||In addition, the DIGS provides a rich description of many domains of psychopathology: somatization, major depression, mania/hypomania, dysthymia/depressive personality/hyperthymic personality, alcohol abuse disorders, pathological gambling, and antisocial personality disorder. It also collects self-reported demographic and medical history data. Ratings are also made on the Global Assessment Scale and the Scales for the Assessment of Positive and Negative Symptoms. Schizotypal and other Axis II Cluster A personality features are assessed by using a modified version of the Structured Interview for Schizotypy.||II. The Family Interview for Genetic Studies (FIGS) As an additional source of pedigree information, the FIGS will be conducted with all members of the family. This interview systematically questions an informant about the presence of psychiatric illness in relatives. We administer the FIGS in three steps. First, the structure of the family pedigree is drawn and reviewed with the informant. Next, psychiatric screening questions are asked about all relatives in the pedigree. Then based on the responses to the screening questions, one or more of five symptom checklists (depression, mania, substance abuse, psychosis, paranoid /schizoid/ schizotypal personality disorder) are completed for each first-degree relative, spouse, or other relative well known to the informant.||The DIGS and FIGS were translated into Chinese. The reliability and validity have been established in our preliminary studies.||III. The Diagnostic Procedure All diagnoses will be made using DSM-IV. These diagnoses will be made by two board certified psychiatrists with clinical and research experience in the diagnosis of psychotic patients. Final diagnoses of probands and relatives will be based on the content of the interview, the case vignette, information provided by relatives and a complete review of the medical record by each diagnostician. If the two diagnosticians disagree about any of the patient's diagnoses, a third diagnostician will be used as a tie-breaker.||IV. Training of Interviewers The training program will certify the interviewers: (1) establish a working knowledge of the diagnostic systems used in the DIGS and FIGS; (2) develop expertise in the administration and scoring of the structured diagnostic instrument; and (3) fully understand the process of informed consent and the need for strict adherence to consent procedures.||The training program is divided into two stages: (1) formal didactic training and (2) supervised experience using the structured diagnostic interview.||The didactic training begins with trainees reading and familiarizing themselves with the diagnostic systems used by the DIGS. This initial exposure is supplemented by lectures which review diagnostic criteria for all psychiatric disorders covered by the interview. Central issues addressed in these lectures are: (1) the importance of establishing diagnoses on the basis of objective behavioral description; (2) careful delineation and differentiation of syndromes which involve both psychotic and affective phenomena; and (3) clarification of major differences in syndrome definition among diagnostic systems.||The second component of training focuses on the structured diagnostic instruments. Trainees first gain familiarity with the structure of the interview. This is facilitated by having trainees conduct practice interviews in which they alternately play the roles of interviewer and subject. These initial interviews are conducted with a senior psychiatrist in attendance to identify problem areas in administration and to ensure clinically sensitive use of the interview.||The training program also includes a module on the modified Structured Interview for Schizotypy (SIS). The SIS training includes a review of the literature about schizotypal personality disorder, an orientation and review of the instrument, an opportunity for trainees to observe and make clinical ratings of a live interview, and a review and discussion of clinical ratings to clarify scoring criteria. All the training courses have been well established in our preliminary studies.||Neuropsychological Evaluations||Considering the complexity of the proposed neuropsychological deficits in schizophrenia, a test battery tapping multiple aspects of cerebral process is chosen to explore patients' overall pattern of neuropsychological deficits. The battery consists of tests supposed to measure:||Sustained attention (the Continuous Performance Test (CPT), both in undegraded and degraded test situations)|Central executive functions (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST); Trail-making B);|Memory function (Weschler Memory Scale-third edition, WMS-III).|Test for general intellectual achievements (block design; picture completion; information; similarity; arithmetic; digit span; digit symbol substitution).||The neuropsychological test used in present study and validity of the test battery have been well established in our preliminary studies. We prepare to administer the neuropsychological test battery to the probands and all the recruited family members as possible. The neuropsychological test battery is rather time-consuming, estimated to take 3 to 4 hours to complete. Hence, the neuropsychological test battery will be administrated in divided sessions, completed in two days. Two master degree research assistants majored in psychology will perform all the tests.||2. Laboratory Work: This project has two lines of laboratory work||Collection of blood samples and extraction of DNA Twenty to thirty ml of venous blood will be obtained from all study subjects into purple top and green top vacutainer tubes. The blood sample in purple top tubes will be used for DNA extraction. We prepare to extract the DNA using a modified salting-out method.|Cell-line set-up All blood samples newly collected will have the lymphocyte transformed into lymphoblastic cell for preservation of cell-line which will be deposited into the cell bank of NHRI as the proposal requested. The detail procedures of cell culture established in our molecular genetic laboratory are listed as attached files molecular genetic study.||3. Data Management We have already set up the computerized DIGS database software in our previous study (Taiwan Schizophrenia Linkage Study, TSLS) and neuropsychological databank in another previous study (Multidimensional Psychopathological Study for Schizophrenia, MPSS). All the clinical and neuropsychological data in this project will be incorporated into these databanks.||The family pedigree data, DNA data, and cell culture data will be incorporated into our previously established databank: Bank of Molecular Genetic Laboratory Data (BMGLD). This BMGLD will include 4 sets of Data: (1) family tree and genotyping data bank. These data are set-up using the cyrillic program ; (2) DNA sample bank; (3) clinical data and endophenotype bank and (4) cell-line bank. This well organized BMGLD will be of great value for continous research work.||The data entry procedures will follow the guidelines that we use for our ongoing projects. These procedures seek to maximize the accuracy of data. The data will be double-entered, and the original and verification files will be compared for discrepancies. All datasets will be backed up to disc regularly. The backup and original data sets will be maintained in different locked offices.||The datasets in this project will be available to other investigators following the guidelines of the RFA. We will create a dataset which will include all data required by the RFA and whatever additional data the NHRI desires to incorporated into the Cell Bank. These data will be sent to the data management center designated by the NHRI for subsequent distribution to the member of genotyping consortium.||Anticipated Results We anticipate through this project to attain the following goals: (1) to cooperate with this important Taiwan Genotyping Consortium proposed by the NHRI, (2) to detect major schizophrenia susceptibility genes which are related to the neuropsychological endophenotype, (3) to do further fine mapping on suggestive linkage chromosome regions to replicate previous linkage studies results using our previously-collected co-affected sib-pair family sample, and (4) to deposit the lymphoblast cell lines into NHRI Cell Bank serving as a national resource for basic research in Taiwan.||Human Subjects This is a genetic study, all subjects recruited will present his signed informed consent before being enrolled for study. There is no invasive procedure of potential hazard in the process of the clinical interview and the neuropsychological evaluations. Blood samples of 30 c.c. will be drawn. This will be done using a needle and this may cause some painful sensation which is usually negligible in clinical setting. These participating subjects will be reassured as any discomfort feeling happens during the study procedures.||All researchers participated in this study procedure are all well trained. If these is any unexpected emotional or physical reaction happens during the study procedure, the P.I. of the project should be informed and necessary actions will be taken immediately. Since this is a genetic study, in the study procedure, there may have the genetic counseling issue raised. The participating researchers will be educated before attending this study for this topic of genetic counseling. These subjects or their family who are in need of specific genetic counseling will be refer to the special clinic, locating in the outpatient department of the National Taiwan University Hospital, of the P.I. of this project for special care.||Animal Investigation not involved.|Potential Hazards The clinical interview, the neuropsychological evaluations, and the blood sample drawn will be very safe. However, this genetic study might provoke some emotional reaction of the family, especially regarding the genetic heritability. In this case, the attending researchers, well trained, will give immediate assurance and assessment. If anything considered to be necessary, these subjects will be referred to the special clinic of the P.I. of this project for special psychiatric care.||The procedure of blood sample drawing might create mild degree of painful sensation or fearful feeling.

"Imaging Cannabinoid CB1 Receptors in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental disorder with a complex and multifactorial etiology. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms have remained elusive, but a large body of evidence points toward abnormalities in a number of brain neurotransmitter systems: dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). Pharmacological studies have shown that acute exposure to cannabis is able to induce psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals and exacerbate symptoms in patients with an established psychotic illness. In addition, epidemiological studies have established that cannabis use in early adolescence is associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia later in life. Together, this evidence suggests that the neural systems targeted by cannabis may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.||The brain endocannabinoid (EC) system is a recently discovered brain neurotransmission system, which involves endogenous cannabinoid agents (ECs) that act upon specific receptors (CB1 and CB2). CB1 receptor is abundant in the human brain and acts as an inhibitory modulator of classical neurotransmitters. ECs and CB1 receptors appear to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. EC levels are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with schizophrenia, and post-mortem studies have shown increased density of radioligand binding to brain CB1 receptors. To what extent CB1 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia in the living human brain is currently unknown. The lack of suitable methods to reliably quantify CB1 receptors in the living human brain have to date hindered the progress in this field.||In this protocol, we outline studies aiming at elucidating the role of CB1 receptors in schizophrenia by using positron emission tomography (PET) and the recently developed radiotracer for CB1 receptors, [18F]FMPEP-d(2). The aim of this project is to explore CB1 receptor abnormalities in human patients with schizophrenia. The primary hypothesis is that CB1 receptor density is increased in patients with schizophrenia in comparison with healthy subjects. Insight into the role of CB1 receptor function in schizophrenia may help guide future development of pharmacotherapies., CB1 Receptor|Schizophrenia|Positron Emission Tomography (PET)|Healthy Volunteers|HV",2
"Cognitive Remediation Program for Hospitalized in the Long Term Patients With Deficit Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a chronic disease with deficit in social interaction and lost of autonomy in daily life. Negative symptoms as blunted affect, avolition, social deficit and anhedonia and cognition were prognosis and functioning key's factors. Psychotropic medications have shown only poor effect to improve negative symptoms and cognition as attention, memory and cognitive flexibility. So, cognitive remediation programs were developped to focus cognitive disorders. The IPT (Integrated Psychological Treatment) is one of the most complete program with modules on cognitive and social abilities. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of IPT+ program to improve autonomy capacities of long stay inpatients suffering from schizophrenia 6 at the end of the program The secondary objectives are to evaluate autonomy 6 months after the program, to evaluate the efficacy of the program on negative symptoms, quality of life, cognitive functions, social cognition and duration of hospitalisation.||This study propose a randomised controlled study with 2 arms, with blind evaluation to compare the IPT+ versus treatment as usual (TAU).

"Effects of Acute Nicotine Treatment on Neuroplasticity and Memory in Patients With Schizophrenia, Background: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is frequently associated with marked working memory (WM) deficits whose pathophysiology is closely related to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)-dependent dysfunction[1]. These deficits predict disease outcome and poor response to antipsychotic treatment[2]. Consequently, elucidating the physiology of DLPFC-dependent WM deficits in SCZ is key in better understanding this illness and its treatment.||Patients with SCZ display an unusually high prevalence of smoking and high rates of smoking cessation failures are commonly associated with WM deficits[3]. The central nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the main target for nicotine. Several lines of evidence strongly suggest that the nAChR system is a promising target for treating cognitive deficits in SCZ. These include the following observations: (1) expression of nAChRs receptors is abnormal in several brain regions, including the PFC, in post mortem brains of patients with SCZ, (2) genes coding for nAChR subunits are candidate risk genes for SCZ and nicotine addiction, and (3) smoking abstinence produce deficits of WM, which correlate with blood levels of nicotine, are alleviated by smoking re-instatement and are blocked by nAChR antagonists in patients with SCZ, but not in healthy control smokers (e.g.,[4]). However, the underlying mechanism through which nicotine and nAChRs affect DLPFC-dependent memory in SCZ are still unknown. Nicotine-induced increases in neural plasticity may represent one such mechanism.||Neuroplasticity, which includes long-term potentiation (LTP), is a proposed physiological mechanism for memory formation. LTP is dependent on an optimal interaction between the glutamate (GLU), dopamine (DA) and γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems and perturbations in these systems likely explain why patients with SCZ demonstrate deficits in WM and neuroplasticity[5,6]. nAChR are present on GABA, GLU and DA neurons and nicotine could potentially improve cognition by modulating these systems. Studies have demonstrated that acute nicotine administration potentiates neural plasticity in the motor cortex of healthy human subjects. One of these studies used Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS), a powerful paradigm to index LTP in the motor cortex, to assess the effects of nicotine on LTP in non-smokers[7]. The results demonstrate that nicotine enhanced LTP-like mechanisms induced by PAS in the motor cortex[7]. To date, however, there has been no direct measure of LTP-like plasticity from the DLPFC in humans. To overcome this challenge, the investigators group has developed a novel PAS technique of combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG)[8] to directly index LTP from the DLPFC.||Conventional methods of applying PAS involves the repetitive delivery of two paired stimulations: the first being an electrical peripheral nerve stimulation of the right median nerve of the hand and 25 ms later a second TMS pulse delivered to the contralateral motor cortex (hence PAS-25). Through repetitive pairing of these two stimulations, PAS-25 results in increased activation of output neurons that represents a direct measure LTP in humans[9]. The investigators lab has recently recorded PAS-LTP in the DLFPC using a novel technique of TMS-EEG[8]. Here, PAS is applied to the DLPFC by repetitive delivery of: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulation to the right side, followed 25 ms later by; (2) a TMS pulse delivered to the left DLPFC. PAS-induced potentiation of cortical evoked activity is then measured directly from the DLPFC and represents LTP in this region as interneurons activated from cortical stimulation and peripheral stimulation, in turn, activate DLPFC output neurons contemporaneously and increase their activity when repeated over 30 min. Thus, the activation of the somatosensory cortex by peripheral nerve stimulation will propagate to the DLPFC and arrive there simultaneously with the TMS pulse resulting in LTP. The validity of this technique relies on the observation that there are strong correlations between TMS induced evoked potentials in the motor and DLPFC (r=0.8-0.85, p<0.001)[8]. LTP is quantified as change in DLPFC cortical evoked activity from baseline (pre-PAS) to different time points following PAS-25 (post-PAS). Preliminary data from the investigators ongoing study using these novel methods, demonstrate that PAS-25 induces significant LTP in the DLPFC. For example, in healthy controls cortical evoked activity in the DLPFC was facilitated by 56% post-PAS (maximal point of facilitation) while in patients with SCZ the cortical evoked activity post-PAS was only increased by 16% (Cohen's d=0.80). This is to the investigators knowledge the first time LTP has ever been demonstrated in-vivo in the DLPFC of humans and the first time that LTP deficits in the DLPFC have been reported in patients with SCZ. The aim of this proposal is now to assess whether enhanced WM by nicotine is mediated by potentiation of LTP in the DLPFC.||Hypothesis:||Patients with SCZ will have reduced DLPFC LTP and impaired WM compared to healthy controls.|Acute nicotine gum challenge will attenuate the DLPFC LTP and WM deficit in patients with SCZ.|Plasma nicotine levels will correlate with improvement in DLPFC LTP.|Reversal of the DLPFC LTP deficit in patients with SCZ will be associated with improvement in WM.||Methods:||Subjects: Fourteen healthy non-smokers and 14 non-smokers with SCZ will complete this exploratory study. This sample size is based on a previous study that used the TMS-EEG method and demonstrated a significant difference in cortical inhibition between healthy controls and SCZ patients[10], and will be sufficient to detect a medium effect size (Cohen´s d=0.72; α=0.05, 1-β=0.80) of nicotine treatment. Only patients that are treated with a stable dose of antipsychotic medication (≥1 month) will be enrolled in this study. This could potentially confound the results as the investigators are using healthy non-medicated controls for comparison. However, the within- subjects design is an effort to control for such effects. Study design: The study will be a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study consisting of two PAS-25 testing sessions one month apart, followed by a 7 day post-PAS follow-up test session each. Pharmacological treatment: Nicotine (4 mg) or matching placebo gum will be administered on each of the two test days before baseline TMS-EEG recording. Maximum nicotine blood concentration is reached after 30 min, at which point blood samples will be drawn to assess nicotine levels. WM assessment: The N-back task measures the ability to maintain active information online (i.e. WM) and is dependent on DLPFC functioning. Letters are presented in a continuous sequence and the subject is asked to respond if they recognize the present letter as the same letter appears that appeared as the N (0, 1, 2 or 3) letters back, i.e. ""N-back"". The N-back will be administered at the pre-test training session (to control for training effects), baseline, 120 minutes and 1 week post PAS. Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS): The pairings will occur over a 30 min period and the peripheral nerve stimulation and TMS to the DLPFC will be delivered at 0.1 Hz. To assure the DLPFC localization, neuronavigational techniques using the MRIcro/reg software and a T1-weight MRI scan will be used. Quantifying LTP: To assess DLPFC LTP, change in cortical evoked activity will be measured using pre- and post-PAS TMS-EEG recordings. TMS pulses will be generated using two Magstim 200 stimulators (Magstim Company Ltd., UK) connected to and a 7 cm figure-of-eight coil via a Bistim module. A train of 100 pulses (0.1 Hz) will be administered together with EEG recordings; (1) before PAS in order to assess baseline cortical evoked activity and (2) at different time points (0, 15, 30, 60,120 min and 7 days) following PAS-25. EEG will be recorded using the DLPFC-corresponding electrodes of a 64-channel Synamps 2 EEG system. Cortical evoked activity will be defined as the area under the rectified curve for the averaged EEG recordings (50-275 ms post-stimulus) and LTP will be quantified as the change in cortical evoked activity from baseline. Statistics: Within and between subjects comparisons will be carried out using repeated measures, mixed-factorial, ANOVAs when appropriate. Relationship between LTP and nicotine levels will be assessed using Pearson correlations. P-values will be set to 0.05 and multiple comparisons will be Bonferroni corrected.||Significance: The results of this study will provide important new knowledge about mechanisms underlying cognitive enhancement strategies in SCZ. That is, the investigators intend to decipher the complex pharmacological mechanisms that underlie nicotinic cholinergic enhancement of plasticity in the DLPFC. Such findings will also help to generate important biomarkers through which cognitive enhancing strategies may be measured biologically that can potentially lead to the development of more personalized treatments of cognitive deficits in this debilitating disorder., nicotine|memory|plasticity|TMS|Paired Associative Stimulation",2

"RCT of tDCS Combined With Cognitive Training in Schizophrenia, The current study is a parallel-group, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial that aimed to fill the knowledge gap in investigating the effect of five sessions of concurrent cognitive training with 'online' tDCS on specific cognitive domains in stable schizophrenia patients at two time-points, (i) immediately after the intervention (ii) at one month after intervention.||It was hypothesized that concurrent cognitive training with 'online' tDCS would result in greater incremental effective improvements in cognitive domains as compared to the cognitive training alone, and the effect would be sustainable at one-month follow-up. The effect of the concurrent cognitive training with 'online' tDCS were also assessed using blinded assessments of psychotic, negative symptoms, affective symptoms, psychosocial functioning, subjective quality of life (QOL) and tolerability in the two groups.||Participant were randomly allocated to one of the two groups using a predetermined randomisation sequence and block randomisation generator (block of 6). Group 1 received active tDCS stimulation and CT and will be referred to as the active tDCS + CT group. Group 2 received sham tDCS and CT and will be referred to as the sham tDCS + CT group. Both groups consisted of 23 participants and received five treatment sessions on five consecutive days.||Stimulation protocol with the corresponding randomisation code was set up by an independent psychiatrist.The double-blind administration panel of the SatrStim8 system of tDCS ensured effective blinding; both the principal investigator and the participants were blinded to the group allocation until the statistical analysis stage.

"Quetiapine Related Neurochemical Changes as Measured by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Schizophrenia, The impact of medications on MRS changes in brain of schizophrenia patients have rarely been studied through a well-controlled study. Most of the MRS studies in schizophrenia patients are cross-sectional and uncontrolled and devoid of any comparison between effects of different drugs. To date, only limited research has explored this issue and the results are conflicting. These conflicting results may be related to small sample size, different patient population and design in these studies. Thus, further studies are warranted. Besides, with the advent of new generation atypical antipsychotics, it will be important to know whether atypical antipsychotics exert different effects on neurons from conventional antipsychotics. If neuronal activity can be improved by atypical antipsychotics, the findings will have great clinical implications.||Fifteen patients in the experimental group will receive MRS examinations (including bilateral frontal and temporal area) in two phases: baseline (when they are on a conventional antipsychotic) and 4 weeks after shifting from that conventional antipsychotic to quetiapine. Another 15 schizophrenia patients receiving conventional antipsychotics will serve as the control group. The control group will receive the MRS examinations twice (baseline and 4 weeks later) without change of medications. In each phase, every patient will also receive the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) assessment.

"Schizophrenia Sensory Gating Deficit With Quetiapine, .Problems with attention and perception are core features of schizophrenia and are hypothesized to result from defects in the filtering or gating of sensory input. Examination of this requires neuoimaging techniques with high temporal resolution. High-density EEG and MEG in combination with structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) are used to map sensory gating. In a number of recent studies patient treated with novel antipsychotics have been shown to have P50 gating ratios resembling those of normal controls rather than that of schizophrenia subjects treatment with conventional antipsychotics. To date, there is no literature on the effects of quetiapine on sensory gating. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and have been on a stable dose of quetiapine for three months will receive a clinical interview, an MRI, MEG, and neuropsychological testing to determine if patients with schizophrenia who are treated with quetiapine will demonstrate a sensory gating ratio similar to normal controls, indicating no deficit in sensory gating., Psychiatry|Antipsychotic|Psychopharmacology|Clinical Trial|Open Label|Schizophrenia|Sensory Gating|Attention|Memory",2
"Appetite Increase in Schizophrenia Patients Treated With Atypical Antipsychotics, Atypical antipsychotics (AAP) have revolutionize treatment of schizophrenia. They are considered to be more effective in reducing positive and negative symptoms and in improving cognitive deficits. They cause less extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia than typical antipsychotics. They still have a lot of important side effects like sedation, metabolic syndrome and weight gain. These effects could lead to obesity, type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, particularly for schizophrenia patients because they are already at an increased risk for these complications. Moreover, an increase in weight gain has been demonstrate to exacerbate negative symptoms and can lead to non compliance with a consequent risk of relapse. It also can create an additional social disadvantage for schizophrenia patients and decrease their quality of life. The weight gain will result, in part from an increased food intake (and probably an increased appetite) and from a decreased energy expenditure.||The purpose of this study is to understand the cerebral mechanisms of appetite in patients with schizophrenia treated with atypical antipsychotics to prevent or treat their weight gain., Schizophrenia|Atypical antipsychotics|Weight gain|Appetite|fMRI",2

"Dopamine Function and Reward Processing In Schizophrenia, Objective:||Schizophrenia (SC) is associated with cognitive impairment in a variety of domains, including learning and memory. The neural underpinnings of these cognitive deficits, however, are poorly understood. Based on evidence that abnormal functioning of brain dopamine (DA) systems is implicated in both schizophrenia and mechanisms of reinforcement processing, we proposed to test theories of the functional role of dopamine in schizophrenia. Specifically, the studies described here test two main ideas about DA function and its possible contribution to SC: 1) its role in facilitating learning of cue-reward associations; and 2) its role in signaling mismatches between expected and experienced outcomes (called prediction errors).||Study Population:||In order to assess brain responses to outcomes, and cues predictive of outcomes, we will enroll 135 total participants (SC patients and controls), aged 18 - 55. For a first set of experiments, we enrolled 54 total subjects (37 SCs and 17 controls) to achieve 34 total completers (24 SCs and 10 controls). In a second set of experiments, our goal is to examine two types of SC patients (those taking clozapine and those taking a different second-generation antipsychotic). For these experiments, we will enroll 81 total subjects (27 controls, 27 SCs taking clozapine, and 27 SCs taking a different second-generation antipsychotic) to achieve approximately 47 total completers (15 controls, 16 SCs taking clozapine, and 16 SCs taking a different second-generation antipsychotic).||Design:||We will measure brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in conjunction with the performance of reinforcement processing tasks from the literature. These paradigms involve either the passive observation of reinforcement contingencies, or the requirement to make an appropriate response within a time window in order to earn positive feedback. The ongoing study uses two specific paradigms: one examining the impact of brain responses to feedback on subsequent learning, and one investigating how brain responses to a monetary reinforcer are modulated by the unexpectedness of the event.||Outcome Measures:||In the current study, we will investigate differences in MRI responses to outcomes between SC patients and controls, and between subgroups of patients. In particular, we are interested in determining whether MRI responses in components of reward circuits, such as the midbrain, basal ganglia, and orbitofrontal cortex, are attenuated in SC patients, in the context of paradigms that require individuals to detect mismatches between expected and experienced outcomes, and to modify responses based on those mismatches. We hypothesize that learning deficits in SC stem primarily from impairments in the signaling of errors in reward prediction, and that abnormalities in the signaling of errors in reward prediction will be reflected in abnormal stimulus-evoked activation in the primarily in two brain areas in SC patients (both DA target areas): prefrontal cortex and the neostriatum. We predict that these signals will relate systematically to performance on a reinforcement-learning task., Classical Conditioning|fMRI|Schizophrenia|TD Model|Incentive Salience",2

"Treatment for First-Episode Schizophrenia, The goal of the study is to prevent morbidity in first-episode schizophrenia using second-generation antipsychotic drugs: olanzapine, risperidone.||Long-term studies of first-episode schizophrenia patients have clearly indicated excellent initial responsiveness of positive psychotic symptoms to treatment with conventional antipsychotic medications. However, in the years immediately following this initial good response, morbidity increases. Relapses, often multiple ones, are the rule and are usually precipitated by medication noncompliance. There is some evidence that the second-generation antipsychotic drugs may have superior efficacy in terms of these outcome domains. However, these newer agents have been studied primarily in chronic and/or treatment-resistant patient samples and there are virtually no long-term studies or studies comparing the new drugs with one another.||First episode patients are randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine or risperidone for 3 years. Outcome measures for the initial episode include psychopathology (positive, negative, and affective symptoms), side effects, neurocognition (executive function, memory, and attention), social and occupational function and service utilization. The effects on long-term course are measured in terms of frequency and timing of relapses, level of recovery from subsequent episodes and prospectively assessed course of psychopathology, neurocognitive function, social/vocational function, and service utilization.||For information on a related study, please follow this link:||http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00320671, Adolescence|Adult|Antipsychotic Agents|Female|Human|Male|olanzapine|Risperidone|Schizophrenia|Antipsychotic Agents -- *therapeutic use|olanzapine -- *therapeutic use|Risperidone -- *therapeutic use|Schizophrenia -- *drug therapy",2

"Effectiveness of an Interactive Educational Website for Improving the Quality of Mental Health Care for People With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a disabling mental disorder that causes hallucinations and delusions in those affected by it. Research has proven that certain treatment methods are more effective in treating schizophrenia than others. However, not everyone with schizophrenia responds to treatment in the same way, and not all physicians use the same treatment methods. Educating individuals with schizophrenia about all treatments available instead of only the treatments they are receiving may improve the quality of care and lead to better correlation between treatment and quality standards.

"Expanding Rapid Ascertainment Networks of Schizophrenia Families in Taiwan, Over the past four decades, researchers have become increasingly certain that schizophrenia has a complex, multifactorial etiology. Although many twin studies confirm that genes play a substantial role in the etiology of this disabling disorder,5 genome-wide linkage analysis of schizophrenia have produced conflicting results. While many of these studies have identified chromosomal regions showing some evidence for linkage to schizophrenia, no finding has been consistently replicated. Given the high heritability of schizophrenia,5 the failure of linkage methods to find susceptibility genes suggests that these genes each have very small, incremental effects on the expression of the disorder. Risch and Merikangas6 showed that for genes of small effect, the power of linkage studies will be low but the power of association studies will be high. Although meta-analysis of candidate gene association studies have implicated some genes, these findings (even if confirmed by larger studies) would only account for a small fraction of schizophrenia's heritability. These considerations suggest that a genome-wide association scan would be an effective method for finding schizophrenia susceptibility genes. To that end, the investigators have designed a multi-stage analytic plan which involves rapid continued ascertainment of probands and family members from an established clinical ascertainment network in Taiwan, performing a genome-wide association scan (GWAS) on this large sample of affected nuclear families, and pooling the novel GWAS results from this project with those from existing case-control GWAS studies of schizophrenia. To accomplish these objectives, the investigators propose a series of specific aims, as follows:||Supplement our previously collected sample of 1,200 Han Chinese schizophrenia-affected nuclear families from Taiwan by rapidly screening and collecting an additional 3,800 trios from eleven ascertainment sites in Taiwan;|Assess the association of schizophrenia with a genome-wide panel of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their constituent haplotypes;|Perform a genome-wide survey for copy-number variations related to schizophrenia;|Test for gene-gene interactions and epistasis;|Test for gene-environment interactions, such as the well-established effect of season of birth;|Analyze quantitative schizophrenia phenotypes, such as age at onset; and|Enhance the NIMH Genetics Initiative collections by sending all clinical data, biomaterials, and genotypes to the appropriate repositories, and completing a meta-analysis of our family-based GWAS data and those from existing case-control GWASs of schizophrenia in the repository;||The above aims achieve the goals of the RFA in several ways. First, the proposed work would markedly enrich the existing resources of the NIMH Human Genetics Initiative, especially the current pool of schizophrenia-affected nuclear families. Not only would the data and biomaterials from this project enrich the NIMH repositories, the study has been designed to be readily combinable with those already in the repositories to boost the power available for detecting genes with small effects on risk. Further, the proposed project would apply the latest genomic research methods to further our understanding of the molecular etiology of the disorder. Lastly, by capitalizing on an existing clinical infrastructure and an efficient screening and assessment protocol, the investigators will obtain a well-powered sample in a very rapid and cost-effective manner., schizophrenia|genome-wide association study (GWAS)|single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)|Han Chinese population|trio families|Schizophrenia with trio families",2

"Neurophysiological Targets for Cognitive Training in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is recognized as one of the leading causes of medical disability worldwide, ranked 9th overall by the World Health Organization, and affects more than 2 million Americans per year. There is considerable evidence to suggest that disability status in schizophrenia relates more directly to cognitive Impairment, involving attention, reasoning, and memory, than to characteristic symptoms of psychosis. Accordingly, the evaluation and advancement of interventions designed to restore cognitive function, generally termed cognitive remediation, is of critical importance to our rehabilitation mission. Recent randomized controlled trials of cognitive remediation in schizophrenia have found moderate gains in cognitive function and improved outcomes in important areas of community living. However, despite these encouraging findings, there remains sparse evidence in support of assumptions that (1) cognitive outcomes represent benefits of training-induced adaptive learning, (2) that training effects are specific to method of intervention, or (3) that change in cognitive test performance occurs through restoration of impaired neural circuitry in schizophrenia. This project will begin to address these issues by examining modality-specific effects of computer-based cognitive training on psychophysiological measures of sensory information processing. Training will be administered using two commercially available computer-based software packages, separately targeting auditory and visually-mediated processes using principles of bottom-up perceptual learning. Two psychophysiological paradigms, mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 generation, will be administered as tests of early visual and auditory processing. MMN and P300 have been studied extensively in human neuroscience as probes of sensory echoic memory and attention engagement to contextually relevant information. Furthermore, reductions in MMN and P300 generation are reliably observed in schizophrenia, follow the course of a progressive neuropathological process, and correlate with severity of cognitive impairment. The specific aims of this study are to determine: (1) whether training selectively influences bottom-up (MMN) or top-down (P300) information processing, (2) whether training effects are modality (auditory vs. visual) specific, (3) whether baseline MMN and P300 predict, or rate-limit, training progress, and (4) whether pre-post change in cognitive test performance is mediated by neural-level change in MMN and P300 generation. Answers to these questions will provide information needed to structure cognitive training for maximum benefit in schizophrenia., schizophrenia|cognitive remediation|rehabilitation|electrophysiology|neuropsychology",2

"Injection Site Tolerability of Multiple Dose Treatment With Long-acting Injectable Risperidone Administered Via Deltoid Muscle in Chronic Schizophrenia Patients., This is an open-label, multiple-dose, multicenter study in chronic schizophrenia patients, who are receiving long-acting injectable risperidone 25 or 37.5-mg injections into the gluteal muscle, and clinically require a higher dose. The study consists of a pretreatment screening phase, an 8-week, open label treatment phase during which patients will receive 4 sequential 2 mL injections with long-acting injectable risperidone (37.5 or 50 mg) administered every 2 weeks into the deltoid muscle in alternate arms (right versus left) for each visit; and a post treatment phase consisting of end of study evaluations upon completion of all the study procedures on Day 57 or at early withdrawal. The study hypothesis is that repeated injections of long-acting injectable risperidone into the deltoid muscle will be safe and well tolerated as assessed by the percent of patients who discontinue after at least 2 injections. Safety was assessed using adverse events (including occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms as assessed by the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale), clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and pregnancy testing), vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and injection site evaluation.

"Amisulpride Augmentation in Clozapine-unresponsive Schizophrenia, This 12-week, placebo-controlled RCT will be conducted in secondary care, specifically mental health services, at UK centres. The health technology to be assessed is the augmentation of clozapine treatment with another second-generation antipsychotic, amisulpride, which will be compared with placebo: 400mg amisulpride or 1 matching placebo capsule for the first 4 weeks, then the option of titrating up to 800mg amisulpride or 2 matching placebo capsules for the remaining 8 weeks. The study will be double-blind, with medication supplied as identical capsules containing either 400mg amisulpride or placebo. The optimum dose of clozapine at entry and subsequent augmentation will be achieved through a flexible dosing regimen whereby treating psychiatrists will be able to flexibly alter dose regimens to maximise clinical risk-benefit ratios; there will be opportunities for clinical titration of clozapine dose at two and six weeks. Any direct pharmacokinetic effect on clozapine levels will be assessed by pre- and post-augmentation plasma levels of clozapine, samples being taken at baseline and at the end of the 12 weeks. Recommended pharmacovigilance procedures will be followed. Clinicians will be asked not to prescribe any additional medication during the course of the study, and will be reminded of the drugs with potential adverse interactions, as mentioned in the SPCs for clozapine and amisulpride.

"Atypical Antipsychotic Treatment Effect On Brain Function In Schizophrenia Measured By FMRI, The general aim of this study was to determine the neuroanatomic basis for cognitive pathology in schizophrenia, as well as the effects of treatment with typical and atypical antipsychotics on clinical symptoms, neurocognition and brain function, as measured with function magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects underwent a randomized parallel group treatment trial that consisted of: a four-week Thiothixene treatment period, followed by randomization, two-weeks cross titration, and six-weeks of double blind treatment with Risperidone (RIS) or Olanzapine (OLZ). Twenty-three patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and fifteen healthy control subjects were initially enrolled. Diagnosis was established with the SCID. Subjects were assessed at two time points, at baseline after four weeks of Thiothixene treatment and at follow up, after eight weeks of double-blind atypical antipsychotic treatment. Controls were assessed once. Symptom severity was assessed using the PANSS. Cognitive functions associated with frontal and temporal cortical regions were probed with a neurocognitive testing battery using standardized attention, executive function and working memory tasks. Frontal and temporal cortical function was assessed with fMRI during the performance of visual and auditory oddball tasks. The visual task oddball task consisted of identifying an infrequent square presented within a series of frequent squares. The auditory oddball task consisted of identifying an infrequent pitch-deviant target tone embedded within a series of frequent standard tones. Thirteen patients and eleven controls completed fMRI at baseline and follow-up.||The results indicated that patients treated with the typical neuroleptic Thiothixene showed significantly smaller extents of activations in superior temporal, anterior cingulate and thalamic regions as compared to control subjects during the auditory oddball task. Although treatment with atypical neuroleptics considerably reduced group differences in cortical activation between controls and patients, the current sample size proved to be insufficient to yield statistically significant group by time interactions. The percent signal change data was in the same direction, but proved to be less sensitive to group differences than the extent of activation. The group differences were not pronounced during the visual oddball task, but were in the same direction., 0",2

"A Study in Italy About Evidence Based Psychosocial/Rehabilitative Interventions in Patients With Early Schizophrenia Treated Continuously With Antipsychotics, Background:||The Italian document Stato Regioni (an agreement between Italian Government and local regions) analyses objectives indicated by the PANSM (Piano Nazionale di Azioni per la Salute mentale - National Plan of Actions for Mental Health) to identify pathways of care for severe mental illnesses (schizophrenia, affective disorders and severe personality disorders) which should be offered by Italian Departments of Mental Health in order to reduce the variability of treatments and to increase the quality of the service offered and the efficiency of resource use. As for schizophrenia, it is underlined the importance that the patient is offered an integrated treatment which involves a multiprofessional team and the application of several clinical and psychosocial and rehabilitative interventions based on the scientific evidence and guidelines recommendations. The proposal of activities should be linked to the patient degree of functional impairment or disability in order to improve patient's functioning and level of personal and social autonomy. This consideration is consistent with the evidence that antipsychotic therapy alone, even if effective on some clinical parameters, should be integrated with psychosocial and rehabilitative interventions to achieve better outcomes in terms of personal and social functioning and quality of life and that ""evidence-based"" (EB) psychosocial treatments (such as cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis, cognitive remediation, family psychoeducation, social skills training and supported employment) are considered more effective than nonspecific and unstructured interventions, which, however, are more often implemented in the psychiatric services. In a Survey recently performed in Lombardia Region the frequency with which community health centers offer their patients any evidence based rehabilitative intervention has been found to be less than 10%, while a percentage of about 18% of subjects undergoing EB treatments (including supported employment) emerged in a wider national Survey promoted by the Italian Society of Psychosocial Rehabilitation (SIRP National Congress, Salerno, 2014; Italian Society of Psychiatry (SIP) National Congress, Taormina, 2015). Unfortunately, transversal or retrospective study designs do not allow to assess accurately the frequency of implementation of specific interventions, which are differently defined and applied in different contexts, and to characterize the clinical-functional features of patients assigned to any specific intervention. The Stato- Regioni document underlines also the importance of proposing an integrated multidisciplinary approach as soon as possible after the diagnosis of schizophrenia and the crucial importance of the continuity of treatment with antipsychotics from the onset of psychosis onward. Unfortunately, no data are available on the implementation of EB treatments in patients treated continuously with antipsychotics in the early phases of the disease.||In front of the importance of offering a wide range of activities to the patient, a high variability of treatments is offered in the different Italian psychiatric departments, with no data available for most Italian regions and, even in the case of the more advanced regions, with a low delivery rate of evidence-based psychosocial activities as compared with other non-evidence-based psychosocial activities.||The pharmacological continuity is a challenge as well. Literature data confirm the importance of poor adherence which may cause not only the occurrence of relapses and re-hospitalizations but also other negative outcomes for the patient, such as the inability to access and maintain rehabilitative interventions and reintegration. Treatment with antipsychotics of patients suffering from schizophrenia should provide a good balance between efficacy, safety, tolerability and acceptability for the patient to determine the continuity and the use of long-acting injection (LAI) antipsychotics is an effective response to these problems, ensuring better outcomes than oral treatment. In addition, drug treatment applied promptly and continuously is particularly important in order to prevent relapses in the early stages of schizophrenia thus limiting the functional deterioration which generally occurs within the first 5-10 years after the first episode and the clinical and psychosocial deterioration which occurs mostly within the first 5 years from the onset of the illness. Moreover, there is evidence in the literature that treatment of first episode patients with a LAI atypical antipsychotic increases treatment acceptability, adherence and the rate of sustained remission.||Given all these premises the investigators are interested in observing how often Evidence Based (EB) psychosocial and rehabilitative interventions are actually offered to patients in the real world clinical practice of psychiatric Italian services able to deliver this kind of treatments, focusing on a cohort of patients with recent onset schizophrenia, for whom delivery of integrated treatments is especially recommended, treated continuously with LAI antipsychotics.||Study objectives:||The primary objective of this study is to explore the level of implementation of EB psychosocial/rehabilitative treatments during a prospective 12-month period in patients with recent onset schizophrenia (< 5 years) being treated with a LAI Antipsychotic in Psychiatric Departments with expertise in the application of such interventions and to describe the reasons of implementing the particular EB psychosocial intervention and the clinical-functional characteristics of patients assigned to these treatments. The prospective design is strictly required both for allowing consistent definition and application of such interventions and for describing reliably the characteristics of patients assigned to these treatments.||Secondary objectives are to describe the reasons for the choice of the specific assigned psychosocial intervention (if any) and the clinical and functional treatment outcomes of patients assigned or not-assigned to EB psychosocial therapies.||Study design:||Prospective, observational, naturalistic study conducted according to Italian law.||The assignment of a patient to any particular treatment is not decided in advance by the study protocol, but falls within current clinical practice.||No additional diagnostic or monitoring tools apply to individuals, with the exceptions listed and allowed by the Italian legislation.

This visit program remains indicative, ie the intervals between visits are the usual intervals of each center and the closest to the expected time assessments will be considered for the study evaluations.||Health economic information will be collected at 6 and 12 months||Statistics and sample size calculation||The primary variable of interest (primary endpoint) will be the proportion of the recruited patients who, in the course of the 12-month follow-up, will be assigned to at least 1 month of EB psychosocial treatment/rehabilitation.||Currently, reliable estimates of such proportion are not available and, in fact, this is expected to be surveyed through this study. In a Survey recently performed in Lombardia Region the frequency with which community health centers offer their patients any evidence based rehabilitative intervention has been found to be less than 10% , while in a wider national Survey about 18% of included subjects were receiving any kind of EB treatment, including supported employment. No data at all are available on the implementation of EB psychosocial treatments in patients treated continuously with antipsychotics in the early phases of the disease. However, the investigators believe that the proportion of patients on EB rehabilitative interventions in this study could be higher than those reported above. The participating centres are, in fact, able to apply effective EB psychosocial interventions. Moreover, the survey applies to patients in the early phases of schizophrenia (< 5 years of illness), i.e. a group of patients who should be assigned systematically to an integrated care according to the Stato- Regioni document, and more adherent to medication since treated continuously with LAI antipsychotics. As the reliability of results depends on the proportion of patients on EB interventions, and as this proportion is still to be defined, the investigators will use an hypothetical percentage of 50% in determining the sample size needed for a given level of accuracy. This assumption will prevent the investigators from having an underpowered survey.||Eighteen is the number of centres identified and recruited to participate in the study. Overall, in 2014, 29527 patients were in charge at those centres. Of these, 4034 (14%) had a clinical presentation compatible with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (F20 according to ICD-10 version 2013) and 1462 (5%) were also being in therapy with LAI antipsychotics. On the basis of these data, it is estimated that eligible patients, namely those having a history of recent illness (<5 years), are approximately 1000, i.e.55 per centre. According to an initial feasibility assessment, it is expected that each centre could include at least 15 patients. Providing a proportion of patients lost to follow-up almost irrelevant, given the ease of detection of the variable of interest, this will produce a sample of prevalence of 270 individuals with a two-tailed 95% Confidence Interval (CI) with a margin of error of around 5%.||The clinical and functional characteristics of patients assigned to EB psychosocial treatment / rehabilitation will be described.||Descriptive statistical analyses will be carried out by calculating the arithmetic mean and standard deviation (median and interquartile range for data with skewed distributions) for quantitative variables, and absolute frequency and percentage for qualitative variables. In addition, calculations will be made of the relevant confidence intervals (95%) for the clinically relevant variables.||If possible, exploratory comparisons of clinical and functional variables associated with the group stratifications generated naturalistically will be conducted.||The data will be entered into a database specifically created for the purposes of this study.||Statistical analyses will be made with Statistical Analysis System (SAS) version 9.2 and values of P <0.05 will be considered statistically significant., psychosocial/rehabilitative interventions|Schizophrenia|evidence based interventions|long acting injection antipsychotic|functional outcome",2

Establish the acute effects of active vs. sham TBS on DLPFC oscillatory activity/NF of EC-SCZ patients. The investigators will iTBS to enhance DLPFC oscillatory activity/NF, as assessed with TMS/EEG, in EC-SCZ patients.||H1: TBS condition (active vs sham) will moderate the change in DLPFC oscillatory activity/NF from pre to post-TBS, such that DLPFC oscillatory activity/NF will increase following iTBS (but not sham).||Aim 2. Assess the impact of acute active vs. sham TBS on WM performance in EC-SCZ patients. The investigators will assess the acute impact of active vs. sham iTBS on WM performance in EC-SCZ patients.||H2: iTBS condition (active vs sham) will moderate the change in WM from pre- to post-TBS, such that AX-CPT performance will improve following iTBS (but not sham).||Aim 3.

"A Safety and Efficacy Study of Bacopa Monnieri and Nardostachys Jatamansi to Treat Schizophrenia, At present, there is no clearly effective treatment of Schizophrenia, which is present in 1% of the population. While acute psychotic episodes are well-controlled with modern medicines, long-term prognosis in terms of quality of life and productivity remain poor. In India, more than 50% of beds in mental hospitals is taken up by Schizophrenic patients, without much of cost-benefit outcome.In clinical practice, Ayurvedic treatment has proved to be effective and well-accepted in patients of Schizophrenia, is safe on long-term use, and may bring about the desired long-term positive changes in patient-health outcome.||In this proposed project, 200 patients of Schizophrenia will be recruited from the local and regional psychiatric institutions. The patients will be in the age group from 18-60 and of either sex. Patients suffering from any organic disorder will not be included in the study. Patients having any concomitant drug addiction will also not be included. Each patient and a close relative (as guardian) will be required to sign a consent form, for the clinical trial, in the regional language. Full, written information about the proposed clinical trial will be given to the patient and relatives. All information will be available in English and two regional languages, viz. Hindi and Marathi. Full detailed history and clinical examination of all patients will be done. Each patient will be interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I DSM-IV Disorders (SCID).Diagnosis of Schizophrenia will be done using the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for Schizophrenia (from American Psychiatric Association:- Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 2000). This will also include classification of longitudinal course in patients having more than 1 year's duration of onset of active-phase symptoms. The clinical profile of each patient will be evaluated using the Positive and Negative Symptom scale for Schizophrenia. This is a structured clinical interview (SCI-PANSS) having 30 items which rate along a seven point continuum (1 = absent; 7 = extreme severe). The assessment provides separate scores in nine clinical domains including a positive syndrome, a negative syndrome, depression, a composite index, and general psychopathology. The SCI-PANSS will be used for each patient initially for baseline evaluation before commencing treatment and later, once in 3 months, to provide assessment of treatment response. The patients will be divided at random into 2 groups of 100 each, one a study group and the other a control group. A brief wash-out period of 2 weeks will be given to patients already taking some medication. The study group will be given Ayurvedic medicine in the dose of 2 tablets b.i.d. of BM, and 1tablet b.i.d. of NJ; with each 350 mg. tablet containing 200mg of aqueous extract .

"Magnetic Seizure Therapy for Schizophrenia, Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is likely to be an alternative options to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).||Widespread stimulation of cortical and subcortical regions is inevitable for ECT since the substantial impedance of the scalp and skull shuts most of the electrical stimulus away from the brain. Nevertheless, magnetic pulses are capable to focus the stimulus to a specific area of the brain because they can pass the scalp and skull without resistance. In Addition, electric current will penetrate into deeper structures, while magnetic stimulus are only capable to reach a depth of a few centimeters. As a consequence, MST are able to generate focus stimuli on superficial regions of the cortex while ECT can't, which may give MST the capability to produce comparable therapeutic benefits with the absence of apparent cognitive side effects., magnetic seizure therapy|randomized controlled trials|schizophrenia|cognition",2

"The Effect of Psychoeducation on Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors in Individuals With Schizophrenia, This study is conducted in pretest-posttest randomized controlled experimental research type in a Community Mental Health Center in the south of Turkey. The population of the study are the individuals with schizophrenia who registered in a Community Mental Health Center and are under observation (N=230). The sample number is determined based on another similar study with power analysis. In the evaluation completed according to the healthy lifestyle behaviours score, the sample number needed to participate in the study was determined to be at least 42 (intervention group=21 - control group=21) in order for research results to have a meaningful effect.In order to reduce the selection bias in the determination of intervention and control groups, intervention and control groups were formed with a third person who did not have a direct role in the research from 1 to 82 using simple random sampling method. The data were collected from 82 individuals with schizophrenia, as 41 intervention and 41 control groups. The individuals with schizophrenia in the study and their families were informed according to the Helsinki Declaration and written and verbal approval were collected. The behavioural change identification form was applied to individuals with schizophrenia, who agreed to participate in the study, and their stage of the Transtheoretical Model was detected. The participants meeting the criteria in the participation stage (contemplation, preparation, action) were assigned to the intervention and control groups with the randomization. Pretests (personal information form, behavioural change identification form, Healthy Lifestyle Behaviours Scale II) were applied to the intervention and control groups before the psychoeducation. In addition to the rehabilitation activities conducted in the Community Mental Health Center, healthy lifestyle behaviours psychoeducation programme, based on the Transtheoretical Model, with 6 sessions (healthcare responsibility, nutrition, physical activity, spiritual development, interpersonal relationships, stress management) was applied to the intervention group for 6 weeks as three days in the weekdays and two sessions in a day. Psychoeducation was carried out by the researcher on the same day but within different time zones. Each psychoeducation session took 90-120 minutes with the breaks taken considering the participants' mood. After completing six sessions, the behavioural change identification form and Healthy Lifestyle Behaviours Scale II were applied to the intervention group again. On the other hand, the control group continued their rehabilitation practices prepared for themselves in the Community Mental Health Center. It was contacted with the control group three times, two face to face and one via phone. In the third and final meeting, when the intervention group's sessions are completed, the behavioural change identification form and Healthy Lifestyle Behaviours Scale II were applied again to the control group. All the participants remained in the study at the end of it. The study was completed with 41 individuals in the intervention group and 41 individuals in the control group. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences v23.0, which is a statistical analysis programme, was used to evaluate the findings of the study. It was benefited from descriptive statistics such as frequency, percentage, arithmetic average, standard deviation, minimum and maximum during data analysis. Parametric tests were used for the data analysis. The chi-squared test was used for relation analysis of two different categorized variables whereas the t-test was used while comparing averages of two independent groups. To determine the alteration of individuals' behavioural change stages before and after receiving psychoeducation, the McNemar test was used. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) while detecting the effect of the intervention study in the researches designed in the entrepreneurial pattern. In ANCOVA, to detect how big the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable the eta squared (effect size) was calculated and the eta squared value (η2) was interpreted that it presents which parts of the change explain the total variant that the independent variable has on the dependent variable and it received a value.

"Treatment Strategy for Refractory Schizophrenia: Drug Interaction Between Clozapine and Fluvoxamine, Background Schizophrenia is one of the most severe mental illnesses. The prevalence of schizophrenia has been variously reported as ranging from 1 to 1.5 percent. More than 50% of patients can be described as having a poor outcome, with repeated hospitalizations, exacerbations of symptoms, episodes of major mood disorders, and suicide attempts. Schizophrenia is costly in medical care, treatment and rehabilitation, and reduced or lost productivity. Therefore, the development of effective treatment for schizophrenic patients is an important issue.||The classical antipsychotic drugs are the dopamine receptor antagonists, which are effective in the treatment of schizophrenia, particularly of the positive symptoms. Even with treatment of typical antipsychotics, about 50% of schizophrenic patients lead severely debilitated lives. Second, the classical antipsychotic drugs are associated with annoying and serious adverse effects. Clozapine has been virtually the only psychopharmacological choice in patients with schizophrenia who either did not response to typical neuroleptics or experienced severe extrapyramidal side effects and consequently did not tolerate this medication. There are patients who do not respond to clozapine, and the need to treat these severely ill patients frequently compels clinicians to adopt therapeutic innovations that lack a sound empirical basis. One strategy is the combination of various other somatic treatments with clozapine.||Recently, the investigators conduct a preliminary open trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fluvoxamine coadministration with clozapine in refractory schizophrenic patients. The mean plasma clozapine levels obtained by clozapine 100 mg/day plus fluvoxamine 50 mg/day is close to that produced by 300-mg/day clozapine monotherapy in one of our previous studies. The combined treatment is well tolerated, and clinical improvement is observed in our patients. And the concomitant fluvoxamine could attenuate the clozapine-induced weight gain and metabolic disturbance. However, the effects of fluvoxamine on the safety and therapeutic efficacy of clozapine need to be further clarified in double-blind study.||Methods This study is a three-year proposal. Sixty treatment-resistant schizophrenic inpatients will participate in this project. The subjects will be randomized to one of two parallel groups: clozapine monotherapy and clozapine plus fluvoxamine treatment. The double-blind active treatment will consist of two periods.||The measures of clinical efficacy will be the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale, Clinical Global Impression, and Nurses'Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation. The measures of side effects will be the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale and the UKU Side Effect Rating Scale. Fasting serum samples are collected to determine the lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, and LDL), glucose level, and insulin level. Plasma levels of clozapine, norclozapine, and clozapine N-oxide will be determined by high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection.||The following results are expected:||In treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients, global antipsychotic effect of clozapine plus fluvoxamine treatment is superior to clozapine monotherapy.|Clozapine plus fluvoxamine treatment has less adverse effects than clozapine monotherapy.|The effect of clozapine plus fluvoxamine treatment on body weight and metabolic disturbances is superior to clozapine monotherapy.|Steady-state plasma levels of clozapine and its metabolites account for a proportion of variance of clinical effects., schizophrenia|clozapine|fluvoxamine|metabolic syndrome",2

"Virtual Rehabilitation for the Treatment of Motivational Deficits in Schizophrenia, Motivational deficits have emerged as a critical determinant of functional disability in schizophrenia (SZ). Despite significant advances in our understanding and treatment of the illness, effective therapeutic strategies for motivational deficits have remained elusive. This has ultimately hindered our ability to promote recovery for individuals with SZ so that they can return to their premorbid level of functioning. An emerging therapeutic approach in SZ has utilized computerized remediation strategies, with recent efforts focused on cognitive deficits. To date, however, such a therapeutic strategy has not been developed for the critical motivational deficits in SZ. In light of the detrimental functional consequences of motivational deficits in SZ, there is a clear need for effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these motivational deficits experienced by affected individuals.

"Anti-Inflammatory Treatment of Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia has been hypothesized to be due, in part, to disruptions of normal immune system and inflammatory responses to viral or bacterial infections or other stimuli of these systems. Epidemiological and clinical studies have provided extensive evidence that perinatal exposure to infection contributes to the etiology of schizophrenia. The recent reports of associations between markers of single nucleotide polymorphisms located within the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6p22.1 and schizophrenia provide further support for etiological hypotheses of immune system dysfunction in schizophrenia.||There are a large number of reports that suggest that people with schizophrenia have altered cytokine levels, with one or more studies reporting elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, CRP, IFN-γ, and TNF-α; and reduced levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine: IL-10. In this study we examine the use of combination anti-inflammatory therapy as an intervention in patients with schizophrenia. We will use||Salsalate, 4 gm/day. Salsalate is a potent inhibitor of nuclear transcription factor NF-κB activation. NF-κB is activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines;|Omega-3-fatty acids eicosapentaenoic (EPA; 2 gm/day) and docosahexaenoic (DHA; 2 gm/day). Omega-3-fatty acids exert their anti-inflammatory effects through their oxygenation into resolvins or protectins, which are potent anti-inflammatory agents;|Fluvastatin, 40 mgs/day. Fluvastatin is a lipid-lowering drugs, which acts through the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA). Fluvastatin may also exert anti-inflammatory effects independent of its lipid-lowering effects via a mechanism involving HMG-CoA inhibition and decreased NF-κB activation.||We have chosen to use combination therapy with three different classes of anti-inflammatory agents to address the potential benefit of this therapeutic approach for persistent positive symptoms and cognitive impairments. The three agents have unique anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action, which we believe offers the most robust evaluation of this therapeutic approach and maximizes the likelihood of eliciting pronounced therapeutic effects., schizophrenia|anti-inflammatory|salsalate|statins|omega-3-fatty acids",2
"A Study on the Brain Mechanism of cTBS in Improving Medication-resistant Auditory Hallucinations in Schizophrenia, Previous studies have shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeted at the temporal-parietal junction can effectively treat genenal auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia, but it is not the case for medication-resistant auditory hallucinations. Studies suggested that rTMS targeted at the left Crus II might be effective for medication-resistant auditory hallucinations.

The continuous theta burst stimulation(cTBS) treatment mode, with the left cerebellum Crus II as the stimulation target, is applied to treat the schizophrenia patients with the medication-resistant auditory hallucinations. Assessment with symptomatology, neuropsychology, neuroimaging, and machine learning methods is utilized to examine the investigators hypothesis that structural and functional abnormalities of the cerebral cortico-cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuit (CCTCC) may contribute to brain mechanism of medication-resistant auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. At the same time, the first-episode schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations were recruited as a test cohort to examine that brain mechanism of general auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia may be the structural and functional abnormalities in the temporoparietal circuit, whereas structural and functional abnormalities of the CCTCC may contribute to brain mechanism of medication-resistant auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia., Medication-Resistant Auditory Hallucinations|Continuous theta burst stimulation，cTBS|Neuroimaging",2

"Minocycline for Schizophrenia, Minocycline has excellent penetration of the blood-brain barrier. In a mechanism that seems to be distinct from its antimicrobial properties, minocycline has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. These properties are thought to be related to some combination of its inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); caspase 1 and 3; p-38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); cytochrome C release; cyclooxygenase-2 expression; prostaglandin E2 formation; and microglial activation. Minocycline has also been reported to have antiviral effects against HIV and antiprotozoal effects against Toxoplasma gondii.||Its use in individuals with schizophrenia has been encouraged by its effects in rodent models of this disorder. In one study, minocycline attenuated the behavioral changes following the administration of an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)antagonist in mice. In another study, minocycline reversed the effects of an NMDA antagonist in rats. Some preliminary data also suggest that minocycline may be useful in patients with schizophrenia. Two case report series have been published, one including two patients with schizophrenia and the other including three patients with recent-onset acute paranoid schizophrenia. An open label study of 22 patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, using minocycline 150 mg/d for four weeks, reported an improvement in both positive and negative symptoms.

In the other study, 54 ""early phase"" (symptoms of less than five years) patients were randomized to minocycline 200 mg/d or placebo for six months; the authors reported a significant improvement in negative symptoms measured using Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI) and a significant improvement in some test of executive function.||These initial findings encourage further replication. First, these studies are of comparatively small size. Second, in countries like Ethiopia where options for the treatment of schizophrenia are limited, identifying a safe alternative to clozapine is important. Related to this, most patients have limited exposure to psychotropic medications. Third, exposure to alcohol and substances is generally believed to be lower in the Ethiopian setting. Finally, given our hypothesis that infectious agents as a cause of schizophrenia may be more important in low and middle income countries (LAMICs) such as Ethiopia, minocycline may prove more useful. In this regard, the trial will help to explore the etiology of schizophrenia. The investigators have experience in following-up a large cohort of patients with schizophrenia and in conducting randomized controlled trials of a similar nature, which makes this proposed study feasible., 0",2

"Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training for Improving Social Functioning in People With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder. People with schizophrenia sometimes hear voices others don't hear, believe that others are broadcasting their thoughts to the world, or become convinced that others are plotting to harm them. These symptoms make it difficult for people with schizophrenia to interact normally and establish healthy social relationships with others. Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST) is a group behavioral therapy intervention that focuses on improving cognitive and metacognitive impairments and social skills deficits that interfere with normal functioning in people with schizophrenia. Goal-focused supportive contact (GFSC) is a group therapy intervention that focuses on helping people with schizophrenia to verbalize their problems or worries and to seek advice from fellow group members. This study evaluated the effectiveness of CBSST versus GFSC in improving social functioning in people with schizophrenia. The study will assessed changes in cognition, psychotic symptoms, and use of psychiatric healthcare services.||Participants in this open label study were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: treatment as usual (TAU) plus CBSST or TAU plus GFSC. Both interventions consist of 2-hour therapy sessions weekly for 36 weeks. Groups receiving each intervention do not exceed ten people. CBSST integrates cognitive therapy, social skills training, and neurocognitive compensatory aids. Cognitive therapy helps participants challenge unhelpful thoughts and build communication and problem-solving skills. Participants receive workbooks that describe the skills and contain homework assignments. GFSC focuses on empowering participants to share problems, worries, or concerns with others who face similar issues. Participants share advice with each other, but therapists do not teach skills. Outcomes were be assessed at Months 4.5, 9, 15, and 21 for all participants., Psychotic Disorders|Schizoaffective Disorder|Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|Social Skills Training",2

"Study of a Neurocognition Enhancing Agent in Patients With Schizophrenia, Aims:||Schizophrenia is one of the most disabling disorders to afflict mankind. Despite the low lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia (1% world-wide), it has an enormous burden in both economic cost and human suffering. There is currently no cure for schizophrenia and its cause is not well understood. Patients with schizophrenia also suffer from negative symptoms (loss of drive, apathy, poverty of speech) and severe cognitive impairments especially with memory, attention, processing of information - the latter of which is most robustly correlated with their role functioning in the community. Addressing these impairments with effective interventions is thus critically important but at this present moment, there is no effective treatment. Recent emerging data from animal studies and a pilot study on small group of patients with schizophrenia suggest that neurosteroids such as pregnenolone may be relevant to schizophrenia pathophysiology and treatment of neurocognitive impairments. This study will be a 10-week randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of pregnenolone. Our hypothesis is patients with schizophrenia randomized to pregnenolone will demonstrate significant improvements in cognitive functioning and negative symptoms compared to patients receiving placebo. The primary aims of the study are to demonstrate the efficacy of pregnenolone in comparison to placebo in patients with schizophrenia which are assessed by changes (from baseline) in the composite score of the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), BACS and the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). Changes in functionality will be assessed by the University of California Performance Based Skills Assessment (UPSA). Safety will be assessed with laboratory tests, well established scales for side effects as well as with a side-effects checklist.||Objectives:||To demonstrate the efficacy of pregnenolone in comparison to placebo in patients with schizophrenia and with cognitive impairment from randomization (Week 2) to Week 10 by using MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery, BACS, Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms, Performance Based Skills Assessment - Brief Version and Clinical Global Impression -Improvement (CGI-I).Additional safety data on pregnenolone in patients with schizophrenia will be provided.||Methodology:||The proposed study is a single-site, randomized, double blind placebo-controlled comparison of adjunctive pregnenolone and placebo. A total sample will consist of 120 clinically stable inpatients and outpatients with DSM IV schizophrenia, with 60 subjects randomized to each group. A best estimate diagnostic approach will be utilized, in which information from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV will be supplemented by information from family informants, previous psychiatrists, and medical records to generate a diagnosis. There will be a 2 week, single-blind placebo lead-in evaluation phase, in which subjects will undergo baseline diagnostic and medical testing, including a physical examination, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Complete Blood Counts (CBC), complete metabolic panel, urine toxicology, and urinalysis. The study is designed to confirm the pilot study results (n=9 per group; total of 18 patients of 21 randomized who completed at least 4 weeks of treatment) in a larger clinical trial (n=60 per group, 120 patients total). Identical to our pilot study, patients will be seen for a total of 6 study visits (every two weeks). The placebo arm is essential as there are no standard therapies for cognitive defects as yet.||Potential Benefits:||While patients may not personally be helped by taking part in this study, their participation may lead to knowledge that will help better understand the illness. It may also lead to better treatment for cognitive deficits and negative symptoms in schizophrenia.||Potential Risks:||Obtaining blood can cause pain, bleeding, bruising, or swelling at the site of the needle prick. There is a risk that some questions on the questionnaires might upset the patients or cause psychological distress. There are no known severe risks that had been associated with taking pregnenolone., Schizophrenia|Pregnenolone|Neurocognition",2

"A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Long-acting Injectable Risperidone and Risperidone Tablets in Patients With Schizophrenia, Although many schizophrenia patients currently take oral antipsychotic medications, it is estimated that up to 75% of them have difficulty adhering to the daily oral regimen. Long-acting injectable formulations may eliminate the need for daily medication and enhance patient compliance with the treatment regimen. This is an open-label, randomized, Phase III trial in patients with schizophrenia. One treatment group receives 25 to 50 mgs of long-acting risperidone, formulated for intramuscular injections, at study initiation and again after 2 weeks, while phasing out any previous antipsychotic medication during the initial 3 weeks of the study. Continuing in the treatment phase, long-acting injections are administered once every 2 weeks through Week 24, and post-treatment observation is performed for 6 weeks (total study duration of 30 weeks). Patients in the other treatment group take oral risperidone tablets, 2 to 6 mgs daily, from study initiation for 24 weeks. Post-treatment observation continues for 1 week for this group (total study duration of 25 weeks). Assessments of effectiveness made at specified intervals during treatment include Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), a scale for the measurement of symptoms of schizophrenia; Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S), a measure of overall severity of illness, and Clinical Global Impression - Changes (CGI-C); as well as, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Safety evaluations include the incidence of adverse events throughout the study; inspection of the injection site at times of treatment; Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS), vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature), and laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) at monthly intervals. The study hypothesis is that treatment with long-acting risperidone injections is not inferior to oral risperidone, as measured by changes in PANSS total score from baseline through endpoint (24 weeks), in patients with schizophrenia and is generally well-tolerated. Risperidone, long-acting formulation for intramuscular injections (25 milligrams[mg] to 50mg, maximum), given biweekly through 24 weeks.

"A Study on Risk Mutations of Vulnerability Genes of Schizophrenia, 4a. Specific Aims. In our previous work based on a Taiwanese sample, we have found that schizophrenia was significantly associated with 11 candidate genes, including GNPAT (1q42.1), DISC1 (1q42.1), MRDS1 (6p24.3), NOTCH4 (6p21.3), NRG1 (8p21-p12), DAAO (12q22), G72 (13q32), CHRNA7 (15q14), PRODH (22q11.21), HMOXI (22q12), and CACNG2 (22q12). In this 3-year proposal, we have 5 specific aims, in which aim 1 is a continuation of our previous study of the Positional Cloning Study of SCH (POCOS) using family data, while aims 2 to 5 are newly developed research goals.||Specific Aim 1: To investigate tighter association of these 11 candidate vulnerability genes with different subtypes defined by clinical or endophenotype variables. The endophenotype variables include the neuropsychological functions of sustained attention measured by continuous performance test (CPT), executive function measured by Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WSCT) and the skin physiological function of niacin flushing responses.||The hypothesis to be tested is that schizophrenia is genetically heterogeneous and the specific risk SNP markers or specific risk SNPs haplotypes of different candidate genes will be associated with specific clinical subtype or specific endophenotype indicators with higher degree of statistical significance.||Specific Aim 2: To search for functional risk mutations of these candidate genes using direct sequencing technique, and to investigate the contributing genetic variance of the specific risk mutations in specific subtypes of schizophrenia, as mentioned in specific Aim 1, using case-control study design. The interaction effects of these functional risk mutations will be explored.||The hypothesis to be tested is that there are several specific risk mutations from 11 candidate genes. The contributing variances of these different risk mutations will be different.||Specific Aim 3: To find the variation of functional expressions of these identified risk mutations in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines of the patient subjects, and neuronal cell-lines.||We hypothesize that these candidate genes have expression discriminations when carrying risk mutations, which will be able to be detected from EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells of these patients and neuronal cell-lines or from constructed reporter gene expression.||Specific Aim 4: To explore and clarify the candidate genes responsible for the impaired niacin skin flushing response in schizophrenia.||We hypothesized that difference in the skin niacin flushing response will reveals difference in the gene expression in the lymphocytes using microarray approach based on a matched case- control design.||Specific Aim 5: To establish a procedure to assess the prepulse inhibition function (PPI) in normal mice as the endophenotype indicator of schizophrenia, and test its validity with acute or chronic administration of amphetamine. This animal model will serve further functional study on the knock-out or knock-down mice carrying these identified risk mutations.||The hypothesis to be tested is that acute or chronic administration of amphetamine will block PPI in wild-type mice.||In addition, we will explore during the conducting of this proposal the following feasibilities: (1) To obtain human brain tissues for studying the functional expressions of these vulnerability genes with specific risk mutations; (2) To employ the animal model to assess neurophysiological and behavioral abnormalities in mice carrying the functional risk mutations; (3) To explore novel treatment for preventing the abnormal neurobiological process due to the risk mutations; and (4)To develop early detection and early intervention program, including genetic counseling, based on the data of risk mutations.||4. Research Plan (continuation) 4b. Background and Significance. Schizophrenia (SCH) is a devastating and stigmatized psychiatric disorder with high genetic loading. The identification of vulnerability genes of SCH is at dawn nowadays. As the vulnerability genes and the specific risk mutations are identified, there will come the revolutionary development in SCH research and clinical practice, including reliable and valid diagnosis based on genetic and related neurobiological data, novel treatment and early prevention of schizophrenia based on the knowledge of abnormal gene function and its interaction with the environmental factors.||The Genomic Psychiatry Study Group (GENOP), a multidisciplinary team of National Taiwan University Hospital, has been successfully operating in studying genetic factors in the psychopathology of SCH. This GENOP has carried out the positional cloning study on vulnerability genes of Schizophrenia (POCOS), supported by NRPGM in these 3 years, and has found 11 candidates vulnerability genes through dense SNP fine mapping study. This GENOP also have a thorough neurobiological and clinical psychopathological study (Hwu et al., 2002; Chen et al., 1998; Chiu et al., 2004; Hsieh et al., 2004; Hwu, 1999; Hwu et al., 2003). Thus, the GENOP is ready to take a step further to search for risk mutations of SCH as proposed here.||We conclude that the finding of vulnerability genes for schizophrenia is at dawn based on the following lines of empirical evidence:||Genetic Epidemiological Study SCH is a highly heritable disease, based on family, twin (Kendler KS 1983; Gottesman II 1993; Prescott and Gottesman II, 1993) and adoption (Heston 1966; Kety et al., 1968, 1994; Kendler et al., 1994) studies with an heritability of 0.70 (Tsuang et al., 1980, 1995; Guze et al., 1983; Kendler, 1988) and a λ, risk to first-degree relatives versus controls, value of 10 (Kendler KS, 1983; Gottesman II 1993; Prescott and Gottesman II, 1993; Chang et al., 2002). An oligogenetic model of SCH etiology was commonly accepted (Faraone and Tsuang, 1985; Risch and Baron, 1984; Vogler et al., 1990, Risch, 1990).||Molecular Genetic Studies of Schizophrenia 2-1. Linkage Analyses Genome-wide scans of SCH for the decade found that many chromosome regions had suggestive evidence for linkage (Coon et al., 1994; Shaw et al., 1998; Levinson et al.1998; Blouin et al., 1998; Kaufmann et al.1998; Faraone et al., 1998; Rees et al., 1999; Williams et al., 1999; Hovatta et al., 1999; Brzustowicz et al., 2000), whereas subsequent studies revealed a replication and non-replication pattern (Riley, 2000). Inadequate sample size and mixed ethnicity might be the major methodological problems (Altmuller et al., 2001, Hauser et al., 1996).||2-2. Candidate chromosome region approach A balance translocation (1; 11) (q42.1; q14.3) was found to be associated with major mental illness including schizophrenia (St Clair et al., 1990). The novel gene DISC1 at chromosome 1q42.1 was repeatedly found to have significant association with SCH, including our Taiwanese samples (Millar et al., 2000; 2001; Hovatta et al., 1999; Ekelund et al., 2001; Hwu et al, 2001; Ekelund et al., 2004, Liu YL et al., 2004).||2-3. Candidate gene approach Many candidate genes, such as dopamine (D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5), serotonin, and glutamate receptor genes, based on psychopharmacological hypothesis (Asherson et al., 1995, Breyler et al, 1995; Hranilovic et al. 2000; Catalano et al., 1993, Serretti et al., 1999; Chen et al., 1996, 1997), as well as developmental- and physiological-based genes such as neuron growth related genes (Margolis et al., 1994), phospholipase genes (Peet, 1998, Wei 1998), and a potassium channel gene (hKCa3/KCNN3) (Dror et al., 1999), have been reported to have association, though not consistently, with schizophrenia. The mixture of ethnicity in the sample may inflate the type I errors.||2-4. Association study using SNP fine mapping and family internal control method By genetic epidemiological guideline such as using linkage disequilibrium strategy and parent-offspring trios as internal control to guide the improved method to locate the susceptibility genes of complex disorder (Risch and Merikangas, 1996; Owen et al., 2000; Baron 2001), there were about 10 candidate genes found by using this modality of study approach (Elkin et al., 2004). These candidate genes included RGS4 (1q) (Mirnics et al., 2001), MRDS1 (6p24.3), DTNBP1 (6p22.3) (Straub et al., 2002; Tang et al., 2003; van Den Bogaert et al., 2003; van den Oord et al., 2003) , TNFa (6p22) (Boin et al., 2001; Pae et al., 2003), NOTCH4 (6p21.3) (Wei and Hemmings, 2000; Fan et al., 2002; Sklar et al., 2001; Skol et al., 2003; Takahashi et al., 2003), PPP3CC (8p21.3) (Gerber et al., 2003), NRG1(8p21-p12)( Stefansson et al., 2002; 2003;Yang et al., 2003) , DAAO(12q22) (Chumakov et al., 2002), G72(13q33) (Chumakov et al., 2002), CHRNA7(15q14) (Leonard S et al., 2002) , PRODH(22q11.21) (Liu et al., 2002; Jacquet et al., 2002) , COMT(22q11.21) (Shifman et al., 2002). Nevertheless, all these candidate genes still wait to be replicated in different study samples.||The GENOP of NTUH, by using dense SNP fine mapping method, have found that 8 significant candidate genes of MRDS1(6p24.3), NOTCH4(6p21.3), NRG1(8p21-p12), DAAO(12q22), G72(13q32), and PRODH(22q11.21), HMOXI (22q12), and CACNG2 (22q12) (Liu et al., 2004). This research team is thus ready to take a step further to search for the risk mutations of these candidate genes and the validation study of these risk mutations. Based on the meta-analysis of published studies, Altmuller et al (2001) and Risch et al.(2000) suggested that high density SNP association analysis in combination with functional genomic data may be necessary to detect susceptibility loci (which may be of small effect) for complex human disease, as shown in a few recent reports (Emamian et al., 2004; Mukai et al., 2004). This proposed RIGOS will follow this strategy as the main approach as shown in our specific aims.||Endophenotype indictors and Issue of Heterogeneity of SCH 3-1. Neurobiological Impairment in Schizophrenia SCH was found to have impairment in neuropsychological functions of executive function, sustained attention measured and working memory (Goldberg et al, 1993) with underlied frontostriatal dysfunction (Elliot et al., 1995), or dysfunction of frontal-temporal-limbic circuit (Gold and Harvey, 1993), or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Weinberger et al., 1988; Berman et al., 1988).||These impaired neurobiological functions had significant association with specific clinical symptoms (Nuechterlein et al., 1986; Hain et al., 1993; Johnstone and Frith, 1996; Liu et al., 1997; Nuechterlein et al., 1986; Strauss et al., 1993; Nelson et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1997) and enduring long term disability (Weinberger et al., 1986; Goldberg et al., 1988).||SCH is characterized by core-deficits in information processing and attentional mechanism (Bleuler, 1911; Kraepelin and Robertson, 1919; McGhie and Chapman, 1961; Venables, 1964; Braff and Geyer, 1990), which was due to the impairment of ""filtering"" or ""gating"" function of brain (Braff and Geyer 1990). P50 event-related potential suppression (P50I) [Freedman et al., 1987; Olincy et al., 2000] and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (PPI) (Braff et al., 2001; Geyer et al., 2001) are reliable measurements. Both P50I and PPI mechanisms, under different neuronal circuits (Swerdlow et al., 2001; Adler et al., 1998), are out of subject's will control, and both are impaired in the patients of SCH (Freedman et al., 1987; Braff et al., 2001), in the spectrum disorder of schizotypal disorder (Cadenhead et al., 1998; Cadenhead et al., 2000) and clinically unaffected relatives of SCH patients (Siegel et al., 1984; Waldo et al., 1988; Waldo et al., 1991; Adler et al., 1992; Clementz et al., 1998; Cadenhead et al., 2000). Both deficits in P50I and PPI can be as the endophenotype indicators with different neural substrate processes. In this study, we intend to use P50I and PPI as specific endophenotype indicator for identifying the possible responsible risk mutations of the possible candidate vulnerability genes.||Animal studies have shown that the PPI deficits could be induced pharmacologically by agents altering systems implicated in the neurobiology of schizophrenia, such as dopaminergic or NMDA glutamatergic neurotransmission (Mansbach et al., 1988; Hutchison & Swift, 1999). This experimentally induced PPI impairment by amphetamine has been conceived as a putative animal model with face, predictive, and construct validities for certain schizophrenic symptoms (Koch, 1999; Swerdlow et al, 2000).||Impairment of Niacin Skin Flush Response in Schizophrenia: The niacin induced vasodilatory response was either absent or impaired in schizophrenic patients (Horrobin, 1980; Wilson and Douglass, 1986; Fielder et al., 1986; Hudson et al., 1997; Rybakowski and Weterle, 1991; Hudson et al., 1997, 1999; Ward et al., 1998; Puri et al., 2001; Shah et al., 2000; Maclean et al., 2003). There is no significant relationship between antipsychotic drug dose and niacin sensitivity (Hundson et al., 1997; Messamore et al., 2003).||The niacin sensitivity may be through the nicotinic acid receptor HM74 (low affinity receptor) and HM74a (high affinity receptor) recently identified (Wise et al., 2003; Soga et al., 2003), and they are both Gi-G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). The two receptors were expressed in the lymphocytes (Wise et al., 2003). The detail molecules and signaling pathway involved in niacin skin flush response still remained to be clarified. In this RIGOS project, it is desirable to explore the possible responsible genes in this un-studied area using microarray method.||3-2. Endophenotype Approach in Molecular Genetic Studies of Schizophrenia To face the genetic heterogeneity of SCH, an alternative strategy was to use specific neurobiological characteristic of the illness as an endophenotype reflecting the effect of a single genetic alteration (Lander, 1988). In this respect, deficits on the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) have been postulated to be a potential endophenotype of the genetic susceptibility to SCH (Chen and Faraone, 2000; Grove et al., 1991; Mirsky et al., 1995; Chen et al., 1998).||CPT deficit was a potential endophenotype of the genetic susceptibility to SCH (Chen and Faraone, 2000; Grove et al., 1991; Mirsky et al., 1995; Chen et al., 1998).||This endophenotype strategy has been successful in mapping of a neurophysiological deficit, decrease of P50 inhibition, to loci at chromosome 15q13-14 (Freedman et al., 1997). The other neurobiological deficit, eye-tracking dysfunction of schizophrenia has been mapped to chromosome 6p23-21 with the maximum multipoint lod score of 4.02 (Arolt et al., 1996). This RIGOS project will take this endophenotype strategy for validation of risk mutations, especially by using attention impairment measured by CPT as well as P50I and PPI indicators.||3-3. Issue of Heterogeneity Genetic and clinical heterogeneity is the main issue in this area of study. Searching for valid clinical subtype and endophenotype are critical for a breaking through study. Our GENOP group had substantial psychopathological data in this area and the RIGOS project will take this strategy.||Functions of Candidate Vulnerability Genes This RIGOS project will tackle on these 11 candidates vulnerability genes identified by our previous POCOS project. The neuronal functions of these 11 candidate genes to be studied have not been well characterized. Current knowledge on the functions of some of these 11 candidate genes are listed as the following: the GNPAT is a dihydroxyacetonephosphateacyltransferase (DHAPAT, or DAPAT) participating in the etherphospholipid biosynthesis (Ofman et al., 2001), the NOTCH4 is a heterodimer receptor involving in the vascular and articular cartilage development (Hayes et al., 2003; Iso et al., 2003), the NRG1 (neuregulin 1) is a group of isoform proteins produced from NRG1 gene by alternative splicing, these isomers interact with ERBB receptor and induce the growth and differentiation of neuronal and glial cells (Kerber et al., 2003; Fallon et al., 2004). The DAAO (D-amino-acid oxidase) is a peroxisomal enzyme activated by G72 (D-amino acid oxidase activator) (Chumakov et al., 2002). The CHRNA7 is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit belonging to the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels and involving in the development of the central nervous system (Agulhon et al., 1999; Raux et al., 2002). The PRODH (proline dehydrogenase) is an enzyme catalyzing proline to Δ-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), the first step in the conversion of proline to glutamate (Harrison and Owen 2003; Lee et al., 2003). Deletion of this gene has been associated with hyperprolinemia (Jacquet et al., 2002). The functional roles of these genes on the neuronal cells warrant further investigation to predict the possible pathological process for schizophrenia. In this RIGOS project, we'll use in vitro cell-line to do functional laboratory study to validate any of these risk mutations identified in this RIGOS project., Schizophrenia|endophenotype|risk genetic mutation|vulnerability genes|affected sib-pairs|case-control design|animal model|functional validity|genetic epidemiological analysis",2

"A Study on Psychopathological Progress of Early Schizophrenia-Like Disorder (SOPRES), Project No: 1 Title: A Study of Psychopathological Progress of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder specific aims are 1) To elicit the psychopathology of identified Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD) and to categorize into 3 groups of pre-schizotypal, schizotypal, and prodromal ESLD. 2) The reveal the prevalence of different neurobiological impairment (studied in Project No.2) in 3 groups of these identified ESLD subjects. 3) The stability of psychopathology of 3 groups of identified ESLD. 4) The process of conversion and conversion rates of psychotic state from non-psychotic state in a 2-year follow-up||Study procedures:||Recruitment:||The high-risk group of schizophrenia will be recruited by referral from psychiatric outpatient clinics in Northern Taiwan, referral from school counseling room in Taipei City and Taipei County, and subjects with known family history from our previous schizophrenia genetic study, which has a size of 850 families. As we have good collaborative works with several psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric departments of general hospitals, it is expected that 100 subjects could be assessed from the outpatient referral. The increasing needs of psychiatric consultation from school system give us a chance to recruit 50 subjects by school referral (school counseling system). Our previous family genetic studies in schizophrenia have already recruited 850 families. As the relatively risk of schizophrenic spectrum disorders (schizophrenia and schizotypal disorder) is much higher in families with schizophrenic patients, and in our experiences the families of schizophrenic patients often expressed worries about developing the illness themselves, it is expected that 100 subjects could be assessed from this population.||The school surveillance will be conducted in three selected senior high schools and three colleges in Taipei metropolitan aiming at subjects fitting our recruiting indicators, including cognitive decline, affective symptoms, social isolation, and school failure (CASIS). A pilot study will be conducted in initial 5-10 nominated candidate students to cross check the validity and applicability of each screening methods. There are 75,084 senior high school students in Academic Year 2003-2004 in Taipei City. We plan to survey the teachers of 3000 students to from 3 senior high schools (around 1000 students each), representing schools with highly-academic-, vocational-, and mixed-orientation. Another 3000 students will be recruited from 3 colleges by administering freshman self-report questionnaire. It is expected that 100 subjects could be identified as subjects with early schizophrenia-like clinical presentations.||The general public will be recruited by respondents to our study ads co-sponsored by the Mental Health Foundation (MHF) framed in terms of highlighting awareness of early cognitive deficits and prevention from severe mental disorders (Caring Brain and Worry Free Program). As the PI had recruited subjects for ""brain bank"" by public advocacy and the Mental Health Foundation already had annual surveys regarding the general public's mental health conditions and subjective well-being with good response rate and the results have been broadcast on major media. Based on the highly expected credit of the MHF, we expect to identify and recruit 50 subjects from this channel.||The normal control will be recruited from the subjects' schoolmates or friends not meeting our recruitment criteria, matched by age, gender, and education. We need 200 normal control subjects based on a two to one ration between the study subject and the normal control.||Referral criteria:||Outpatient group: suspected ""latent"" or ""beginning of"" schizophrenia based on psychiatrists' clinical experiences; school referral group: problematic students unable to be explained by common conduct problems or psychosocial issues from teachers' perspectives (un-understandable emotional, behavioral, interpersonal, or academic problems); family study group: siblings or offspring of schizophrenic patients exhibiting symptoms or behavioral patterns warrant family's attention (something reminding them about their schizophrenic relatives).||3) Recruitment criteria: (CASIS) Cognitive deficits: subjectively poor concentration; decline of intelligence; inefficient learning; rigid thinking; Affective symptoms: unexplainable depressiveness, anxiousness, fearfulness, obsession, or hypochondriacal ideas; social isolation: having less than two close friends; generally withdrew, distant, aloof, or isolated; frequent absence without identifiable causes; school failure: markedly deterioration of academic performance or quitting school.||Subjects presenting at least two of the above conditions (one of cognitive deficit and at least one of the remaining three) will be screened for psychotic-prone symptoms by the Latent Schizophrenia Screening Sheet (LSSS) (necessary to have cognitive deficit) of 26 items (6 dimensions) including thoughts, perceptions, inappropriate behaviors, affective symptoms, interpersonal relationship, and neurotic symptoms. Subjects respond ""sure"" for any item of the LSS will be recruited for further assessments.||Anticipated Results: The cross-sectional and longitudinal progress of psychopathology of ESLD will be revealed. The comprehensiveness and the domains of psychopathology of ESLD will be elicited. The progressing process of the psychopathological domains will be characterized.||The validity of subgrouping of ESLD into pre-schizotypal, schizotypal and prodromal types will be determined.|We'll reveal the pattern of aggravation of symptomatic level as time goes by: more subjects progress to the severer level during the 2-year follow-up (i.e., from pre-schizotypy to schizotypy, from prodrome to SCH, etc; few subjects could ""drift back"" to the milder symptomatic level (i.e., from prodrome to schizotypy or from schizotypy to pre-schizotypy, etc).|To determine some specific items in the screening tools, i.e., LSS, SOPS, for better positive predictive values than the others.|The sensitivity and specificity of the screening tools will be examined using neurobiological indicators (Project No.2) by constrast validity testing.||Project No: 2 Title: Neurobiological Study of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD) Specific Aims: Based on the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia (SCH), it is assumed that clinically identified pre-psychotic state of SCH, termed as Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD)(Project No.1), may have impaired neurobiological functions. Our previous family-based studies also supported that some neurobiological markers, such as sustained attention deficits, were potential endophenotypes of schizophrenia (see background below). Therefore, in Project No.2 of the Study on Psychopathological Progress of ESLD (SOPRES) Program, we plan to adopt multi-level approaches to investigate the potential neurobiological changes in patients with ESLD. The approaches include certain specific neuropsychological, neurophysiological and neuroimaging measurements.||The specific aims of neuropsychological study are as follows: 1) to examine whether individuals with ESLD evidence controlled processing dysfunction of neurocognition; 2) if true, to further explore whether such dysfunction involving neurocognitive domain is simplex or multiplex in nature; 3) to determine whether neurocognitive controlled processing measure(s) used in the present study can be a useful screening tool for ESLD and further for early detection of schizophrenia.||The specific aims of the other dimensions of neurobiological studies are:||To clarify the prevalence of impaired flush response to Niacin skin patch in ESLD and to assess the predictive validity of Niacin skin test in the progression of schizophrenia;|To reveal the prevalence of two brain inhibitory functions (i.e. prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI) and P50 event-related potential (ERP) suppression) in ESLD and the change along clinical course of those ESLD subjects;|To measure the regional changes of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in hippocampus and frontal lobe in subjects with ESLD, and define the predictive validity in the follow-up course.|To measure the connectivity and diffusion anisotropy between the hippocampus and frontal lobe by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in subjects with ESLD, and define the predictive validity in the follow-up course.|To evaluate the possibility of skin niacin response/MRS/DTI/P50/PPI as endophenotypes in further genetic research of schizophrenia.||The importance of the specific inhibitory measures also resides in the fact that they are understood at neurobiological (and in some cases, molecular) levels, based on extensive human and animal model studies.||P50 Suppression:||P50 suppression is an important endophenotype of schizophrenia. P50 suppression occurs when two clicks are presented with a 500 msec interstimulus interval. The impaired suppression of the P50 to the second stimulus has been reported in a number of studies in chronic schizophrenia patients, both medicated and unmedicated, first-episode patients, and first-degree relatives of schizophrenics, as well as schizotypal individuals.||Impaired P50 suppression is extensively studied using anatomical and molecular genetic and other neurobiological studies. These findings support that P50 suppression impairment is a possible endophenotype of information processing deficits in schizophrenia.||Prepulse inhibition (PPI):||PPI of the startle response is an operational measure of preattentive sensorimotor gating. The term startle modification refers to the changes in the startle reflex, induced by various stimulus modalities, when the startle-eliciting stimulus is preceeded by a (usually weak) stimulus called a prepulse. It is stable over time in both normal subjects and schizophrenia patients.||Deficits in PPI have been consistently identified in schizophrenia, and PPI is an excellent candidate endophenotype in schizophrenia since PPI deficits occurred in schizophrenia patients, and schizotypal personality disorder patients.||To study the presence and change of impaired PPI and P50 suppression in ESLD may help us clarify the stability of the impairment along the disease course and the validity of using the PPI and P50 test as a screening tool for pre-psychotic state of schizophrenia.||Project No: 3 Title: Family Genetic Study of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder I. Specific Aims: Genetic high-risk (HR) approach, in which subjects with one or more affected relatives were recruited since infancy or early childhood, has been the most commonly adopted one to address the early detection of schizophrenia (1). However, as pointed out in a recent review (2), there are two major limitations of these studies. First, because the majority of these genetic high-risk studies were started 30-40 years ago, many of them used methods that are outdated and sometimes focused on less relevant subjects in their assessments. Second, only approximately 10% of the HR children develop schizophrenia, making the predictions concerning vulnerability indicators unprecise. Recently an alternative approach called clinical high-risk or ultra-high-risk has been advocated, in which adolescents or young adults referred for mental health evaluation with attenuated psychotic symptoms or behavioral problems commonly observed in the HR children were recruited for prospective follow-ups (3, 4). In this PPG, we propose an approach that combines both genetic HR and clinical HR to enrich the recruitment of subjects at increased risk of developing early schizophrenia-like disorder (ESLD).||Moreover, the interpretation of the contrast between HR subjects and normal controls or between HR with onset of schizophrenia and HR without onset of schizophrenia tends not to be straightforward. Any neurodevelopmental disturbances can be distributed in two independent dimensions: a genetic-environmental causal continuum and an early-to-late maturation expression continuum (5). A factor that is present in an HR subject but absent in normal controls is not necessarily of genetic origin. One way to distinguish is to examine whether a similar deficit is present in other non-HR sibling of the HR proband. However, previous HR studies tended to measure only the HR subject in each family.||In this component project, we propose to adopt a family-genetic approach to provide more information for the interpretation of the contrast between HR of different severity and normal controls or between HR with progression to a more severe stage and HR without such progression. The specific aims of this component project are as follows:||Aim 1:To assess to what extent the psychopathological features identified in the probands of pre-schizotypal ESLD, schizotypal ESLD, prodromal ESLD, or early schizophrenia are also present in their first-degree relatives.||Aim 2: To assess to what extent the neurodevelopmental or neurobiological impairment identified in the probands of pre-schizotypal ESLD, schizotypal ESLD, prodromal ESLD, or early schizophrenia are also present in their first-degree relatives.||Aim 3: To assess to what extent the conversion in psychotic-like state of the three groups of ESLD probands can be explained by the presence of psychopathological, neurodevelopmental, or neurobiological features observed in their first-degree relatives.||The probands of the three groups of ESLD (pre-schizotypal ESLD, schizotypal ESLD, and prodromal ESLD), early schizophrenia, and normal controls will be recruited by the Component Project 1 of this PPG. On the basis of these probands, this Component Project will recruit their first-degree relatives to participate in the study. Part of these probands will have neurobiological assessment conducted in Component Project 2. Part of the family identified in this Component Project will be evaluated for help-seeking behavior. In these joined efforts, we will be able to decipher the psychopathological pathways for both genetic and environmental etiological factors.||Core Unit Code No: A Title: Core Unit of A Study on Psychopathological Progress of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (CUSOPRES) This PPG of Study on Psychopathological Progress of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD) [SOPRES] is composed of 4 inter-related projects: (1) A Phenomenological Prospective Follow-up Study of ESLD; (2) A Neurobiological Study of ESLD; (3) Family Genetic Study of ESLD; (4) Awareness and Pathways to Care in ESLD.||The study samples participate all these four projects. The major hypothesis of the SOPRES was based on neurodevelopmental etiological hypothesis of schizophrenia. The hypothesis testing is interrelated among three projects No.1, No.2 and No.3. The projects No.4 is supplementary to other 3 projects. This SOPRES belongs to a translational study. Project No.4 is essential to bridge the process for clinical application of this SOPRES.||Based on these predicted research activities commonly needed for these four projects of this PPG, an efficient Core Unit of this SOPRES (CUSOPRES) is mandatory for carrying out the research work smoothly. There are several sections of research-related work of this CUSOPRES||Administrative Coordination of this SOPRES:||This CUSOPRES has to coordinate the regular research meeting, to make record of this research meeting. Literature related to this SOPRES PPG has to be collected and to be distributed to all research participants. It has to monitor the reality of the progress of this SOPRES. The progress of sampling, data collection, data check, setting up computer data file has to be monitored weekly. Report of research progress has to be done and has to be distributed to all main researchers. All the filing system of this SOPRES has also to be done by this CUSOPRES.||2. Budget management: Some proportion of the budget are commonly used in three projects. Each project also has its own budget schedule. The salary system of all research assistant has to be scheduled and managed clearly. This budget is of government grant. Detailed descriptions and records of budget expenditure are critically demanded by the regulatory and census system of the government. The expenditure every year must to be regulated to meet the requirement of research activity. This CUSOPRES has to manage all these works. A full time business assistant is necessary.||3. Training of Research Assistants and Participant Researchers: This PPG OF SOPRES will recruit research assistants (RA) for sampling, for data collection and data management. In Taiwan, the job of RA is always in a temporary basis. They (RA) come and go. All these RA's enrolled have to receive a through training for their work to guarantee high training of data collection and data management. All participant young researchers of all different disciplines also have to arrange training program related to the SOPRES research activities. This training program has to be arranged, scheduled and managed by the CUSOPRES.||4. Manuscript Preparation and Submission. Other than collecting new data, this PPG also have abundant data bank of previous psychopathological studies. As stated in the preliminary work of these three projects, these data has to be analyzed along the progress of data collection of this SOPRES. These continuous data analysis will create many drafts of paper manuscripts. Thus, this SOPRES PPG will have many manuscripts preparations for submitting to international and/or domestic journals. Typing, editing, and the preparation of these manuscripts are part of the work of this CUSOPRES. This is one important supporting function of CUSOPRES.||5. Data management and Data Analysis After preliminary management of data collected from the study subjects, all research data have to be set up in suitable computer data bank. Data cleaning is important work. Integrated data analyses of this SOPRES are unique of this SOPRES PPG. Other than independent analysis of the specific project itself, coordinated and mutual data matching analysis is unique of this SOPRES. The clinical definition of ESLD will be validated by concurrent psychopathological data (Project No.1) and follow-up data, and will be validated by all different dimensions of neurobiological data (Project No.2). The clinically defined ESLD will also be validated by family genetic data. Most importantly, heterogeneity of ESLD will also be explored using statistical maneuvers and then, will receive further validation study.||Data Structure and Statistical data analysis||Figure1 illustrates the possible data relationship and statistical analysis tools and data analysis strategies to be involved in and incorporated into the project. Structure of data sets to be collected by four component projects is very complicate in nature:||. Data sets to be collected by all four projects are inter-correlated and dependent. Subjects may be stratified by various relationships among all four projects.|. Data sets are highly multidimensional. Each program project employees multiple interviewing and measurement tables. Subjects match different criteria may have different sets of measurements.|. These measurements have different scales: ratio, interval, ordinal, nominal. Multivariate variables with different scales will be studied simultaneously.|. Some of the subjects/measurements combinations may have longitudinal pattern with follow-up studies.|. Data sets collected by Project 3 may be of dependent nature - samples are clustered as families.||Due to the high complexity of the data structure involved, the core unit has the following strategies to handle the statistical data analyses for all different project/subject/table/variable combination and situation:||. Descriptive statistics and various exploratory data analysis (EDA) tools will first be used to study the basic distribution structure for all the subjects/variables collected. This provides the researchers most of the univariate distributions and some of the associations structure of tables.|. Generalized association plots (GAP), developed by Dr. Chun-houh Chen (Chen 2002) for our previous projects, will also be used to explore the basic clustering structure of subjects and grouping structure of variables and the interaction patterns of the subject-clusters with variable-groups for each individual data table and combination of tables. This provides us an overall picture of data structure for all the subjects/tables involved.|. Many conventional multivariate statistical analysis tools will be employed to conduct further exploratory analyses and some confirmatory studies for the data.|. Various statistical testing procedures will also be used to verify and answer some of the hypotheses generated and proposed by all four component projects. The results may lead to new or modified hypotheses. Statistical analyses and hypothesis testing procedures will be performed again to verify the new hypotheses.|. Various statistical and epidemiological genetic analysis tools are to be used for analyzing the familial data generated by project 3.|. Latent class model (LCM) developed by Dr. Huang (Huang & Bandeen-Roche 2004, Huang 2005) can be used to study subject clustering pattern for various project/table combination.|. CateGAP, longGAP, canoGAP will be applied to study the categorical, longitudinal, and canonical relationship data structure respectively.|. New statistical methodologies and data analysis procedures suitable for analyzing specific data pattern to be generated by all four projects will be developed by the statisticians of the core unit when there is the need.||6. International and Domestic Communication Related to academic activities of this SOPRES, this SOPRES focuses on the up-to-date psychopathological study issue. All participant researchers of this SOPRES have abundant communication with other academic institutes or personnel for academic interests. This CUSOPRES has to manage all these communications.||7. The GENOP research team of this SOPRES program has also done the positional cloning study in order to find the vulnerability gene of schizophrenia in an independent molecular genetic study on SCH. We have found 12 potential candidate vulnerability genes up to now. In the coming years, there will be risk mutations identified in these vulnerability genes. These risk mutations will be as the direct genetic marker to validate the different groups of ESLD. This core unit will hire one assistant of bachelor degree to do blood sample collection and DNA extraction, as well as lymphocyte immortalization by EBV transformation.||8. Summary and Significance||This PPG of ""A Study on Psychopathological Progress of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (SOPRES)"" was designed to validate Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD) defined clinically, using neurodevelopmental-associated core psychopathology. The SOPRES will recruit subjects of potential cases of ESLD using clinical psychopathological data obtained by self-report and face-to-face interview approach. Three groups of ESLD will be defined: (1) pre-schizotypal (or pan-neurotic), (2) schizotypal and (3) prodromal groups. These three groups represent three steps of psychopathological progress of ESLD. Using prospective follow-up design, the conversion rates of these three groups converted into successive group and into frank psychotic state of schizophrenia will be revealed. These clinically defined cases will be validated using neurobiological indicators, such as neuropsychological, neurophysiological, niacin skin flushing test, neurochemical, neuroanatomical indicators (Project No.2) as well as family genetic epidemiological data (Project No.3). The subtypes of ESLD will also be delineated using these validation procedures. The awareness, reaction and coping strategy of the patients and the family care-givers will be elicited as well. This SOPRES is 5-year study design, which includes 4 study periods: (1) half year preparation, (2) 2 years of case recruitment, (3) 2 years of follow-up and (4) half year ending and data management.||The psychopathology of schizophrenia has been well studied in the past decade. The SOPRES is a translational study design to examine the psychopathological progress of the pre-psychotic state of schizophrenia based on neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia. This SOPRES is, thus, of high academic merit in the study of schizophrenia psychopathology. This SOPRES will demonstrate the successful application of basic neurobiological study data on clinical condition of ESLD.||This SOPRES will successfully set up a battery for valid diagnostic assessment of ESLD covering multidimensional psychopathology and it will also reveal the psychological progress of ESLD. This valid diagnostic assessment of ESLD will identify cases of ESLD from the cases with school failure, job difficulty, and of anxiety-depressive disorders in general psychiatric clinics. This will be helpful for avoiding the undesirable clinical condition of mis-diagnosis and mis-treatment. This will also substantiate the background for the development of further frontier of early intervention of ESLD. As schizophrenia is a devastating disease for the patient himself/herself, the family and the society. It also carries heavy psychosocial stigma. The result of SOPRES will be very helpful for building up early, intervention of schizophrenia, and will contribute a lot in reducing the cost of schizophrenia. The SOPRES study results regarding the awareness and coping strategy of the patients and the family will provide useful empirical data for developing psychosocial service for the ESLD.||This SOPRES study will provide the learning experience for participating researchers, including research assistants in the area of developing diagnostic assessment, combing clinical psychopathology and neurobiological pathology of early pre-psychotic state of schizophrenia. This experience will cultivate the future professional persons in the research area of preventive psychiatry.||9. Institutional Environment and Resources||This PPG of SOPRES will be carried out with the main researcher center located at the Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University. There are main psychiatric hospitals affiliated with this research center. Massive case and family recruitment in local and nationwide programs for molecular genetic study of schizophrenia has been carried out by this research center and the affiliated hospitals. This research center has been doing psychopathological study on schizophrenia in its academic tradition. This research center is one part of the active medical campus of the National Taiwan University. Multidisciplinary team related to neurobiological study has been organized for years. These neurobiological studies of neuropsychological, neurophysiological and neuroimaging fields and neurobiological technology have been well developed. This university medical campus is very active in collaborating with other research sections as shown by this PPG of SOPRES. The Department of Imaging, Department of Neurology, Department of Nursing, and Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine; Department of Psychology, College of Science, Department of Social Worker, College of Social Science, Institute of Epidemiology, College of Public Health of the same University are integrated with this PPG. The active research centers of statistical science located in Academia Sinica, and National Chiao Tung University, as well as Institute of Anthropology, National Tsing Hua University are also integrated into this PPG of SOPRES. These institutions are all engaged in biomedical research actively and also encouraging researchers to pursuit incultidisciplinary collaborative research too. The clinical phenomenological study, follow-up study, genetic laboratory, the neuropsychological, neurophysiological, the neuroimaging technique, and statistical technology are well equipped and well developed in these collaborative research centers and well mastered by these participating researchers.||Besides, this research center is the leading center of psychopathological study and service in the area of adolescent Psychiatry. There was wide and intensive connection between this research center and schools. Besides, this research center has also been involved with public mental health promotion through Mental Health Foundation (MHF). These intensive connections and wide resources are crucial for the successful case recruitment of ESLD targeted by this SOPRES program., Schizophrenia|PPI|P50I|MRS|Niacin|Candidate Genes",2
"Timing of Voluntary Movement in Patients With Schizophrenia, Objectives||The purpose of this study is to determine how the subjective sense of willing and initiating an action is altered in schizophrenic patients. One proposed explanation for characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia (""passivity phenomena"") is a defect in the forward model of movement that the brain receives as the motor signal is generated. We propose to examine this forward model using Libet's paradigm, in which normal subjects gave evidence for a forward model in their anticipatory reports of initiation of movement. We intend to determine the times associated with willing (W), initiating (M), and electroencephalographic/electromyographic (EEG/EMG) measures of movement.||Study Population||We intend to study adult patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders diagnosis of schizophrenia. These patients provide a unique population for this study because they often do not have the sense that they direct their own movement or author their own thoughts (passivity phenomena). Studies have shown that schizophrenics have movement-related cortical potentials on EEG, but it is not known when the subjective sense of initiating movement occurs for these patients. As the order of mental events in time has been shown to contribute to the sense of agency, it is important to know how the timing of voluntary movement is altered in schizophrenia.||Design||We will ask patients to look at a fast-rotating clock on a computer screen and note when their movements were willed, instigated by an external agent if they have such delusions, and were initiated. Patients will also report the time of a somatosensory stimulus. Surface EMG will determine the time of actual movement, and EEG will record brain potentials associated with movement. Eligible patients with schizophrenia and passivity phenomena will be recruited from the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch, NIMH.||Outcome Measures||The primary outcome measure of this study is the absence of time W in some schizophrenics, the latency of W in other schizophrenics compared to normal subjects, and the latency of M in schizophrenics compared to normals. Any effect of medication status or symptoms on performance in the study will be considered exploratory data., Bereitschafts Potential|Timing of Volition|Somatic Passivity Phenomenon|Conscious Will|Libet's Clock|Schizophrenia|Healthy Volunteer|HV",2
"A Safety and Tolerability Study of Paliperidone Palmitate Injected in the Shoulder or the Buttock Muscle in Patients With Schizophrenia, To date, all prior trials involving intramuscular injection of paliperidone palmitate were conducted with buttock administration.

"50 Hz vs. 25 Hz Magnetic Seizure Therapy for Schizophrenia, Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is likely to be an alternative options to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).Widespread stimulation of cortical and subcortical regions is inevitable for ECT since the substantial impedance of the scalp and skull shuts most of the electrical stimulus away from the brain. Nevertheless, magnetic pulses are capable to focus the stimulus to a specific area of the brain because they can pass the scalp and skull without resistance. In Addition, electric current will penetrate into deeper structures, while magnetic stimulus are only capable to reach a depth of a few centimeters. As a consequence, MST are able to generate focus stimuli on superficial regions of the cortex while ECT can't, which may give MST the capability to produce comparable therapeutic benefits with the absence of apparent cognitive side effects. Though high dose (frequency) MST is gaining popularity, there is no evidences supporting its superiority over low dose (frequency) MST either on efficacy, safety, or seizure quality., magnetic seizure therapy|schizophrenia|controlled trial|cognition",2

"Clinical Effectiveness of Newer Antipsychotics in Comparison With Conventional Antipsychotics in Schizophrenia, There is agreement in the psychiatry community that the so-called atypical antipsychotics should be considered first choice in the treatment of schizophrenic disorders. However, the general superiority of these newer antipsychotic drugs over the older conventional drugs could not be clearly demonstrated in recent controlled clinical trials. The discrepancy between every day's clinical perception and the results of clinical trials raises the question whether the studies performed so far employed the adequate methodological approach to represent the daily practice situation which is characterized by a wide variety of duration and type of the schizophrenic disorder, concomitant diseases, and medications. Moreover, some studies might not have been focused adequately on patient-relevant outcome variables.||The present study project is designed to answer these open questions. The innovative character of the study design is||that different neuroleptic strategies will be compared rather than single antipsychotic drugs, using|an enhanced biometric design, that provides a choice of treatment with respect to the individual patient though the trial as such is randomised controlled and double blind;|that clinically relevant endpoints such as quality of life will be the primary variables, and|inclusion and exclusion criteria lead to a study population representing clinical every day practice as near as possible.||Another innovatory procedure is that serum levels of the study drugs will be recorded twice during the study. The authors hope that their design might yield transfer effects for other clinical trials facing similar problems., Schizophrenia|atypical antipsychotic drugs|conventional antipsychotic drugs|olanzapine|quetiapine|aripiprazole|haloperidol|flupentixol",2
"Imaging of Brain Receptors in Healthy Volunteers and in Patients With Schizophrenia, Abnormalities of nicotinic acetylcholine system in schizophrenia are implied by the high prevalence of cigarette smoking. Because animal and human studies have shown that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play an important role in cognitive function, cognitive deficits in schizophrenia also suggest abnormalities in these receptors. Postmortem studies showed abnormalities in high affinity nAChRs in these patients but the direction of the abnormalities (increase or decrease) were not consistent probably because it is difficult to control the effects of cigarette smoking and neuroleptics in such studies. In vivo imaging studies are necessary to study relationship between nAChRs and psychiatric symptoms including cognitive impairments.||We plan to use a new single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) tracer, [(123)I]5-I-A-85380, which appears suitable for imaging the high affinity Alpha 4 Beta 2 subtype of nAChRs. We plan to compare four groups, 1) schizophrenia smokers, 2) schizophrenia non-smokers, 3) healthy smokers, and 4) healthy non-smokers. All patients will be on stable doses of olanzapine or risperidone. In addition to comparing [(123)I]5-I-A-85380 binding among these groups, relationship will be studied between psychiatric symptoms or cognitive dysfunction and the SPECT measurement of the receptors. Further, to study the reliability of the SPECT measurement, a test retest study will be preformed in healthy subjects with a wide range. The proposed study will explore the roles of nAChRs in the psychiatric symptoms, particularly the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, which is the central impairment of this disorder. New findings in this research will lead to enhanced treatment of the cognitive deficits., Schizophrenia|SPECT|Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors|Cigarette Smoking|Cognitive Dysfunction|Reproducibility|Quantification|Healthy Volunteer|HV",2

"A Comparison of the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Long-acting Injectable Risperidone When Administered to Gluteal or Deltoid Intramuscular Injection Sites in Stable Schizophrenia Patients., This is a randomized, open label, single dose, multicenter, 2-way crossover study comprising a screening phase, 2 open-label treatment periods, and end-of-study evaluations. The study population will comprise patients with chronic stable schizophrenia. Patients will be allowed to continue on their existing oral antipsychotic treatment throughout the study, if not receiving disallowed mediations, per protocol. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive treatment in 1 of 2 panels. In each panel, patients will receive a single intramuscular injection of long-acting injectable risperidone in each treatment period, in a 2-way crossover design. In Panel I, patients will receive 25 mg long-acting injectable risperidone via the gluteal muscle and 37.5 mg long-acting injectable risperidone via the deltoid muscle during the study period. In Panel II, patients will receive 50 mg long-acting injectable risperidone via the gluteal muscle and 50 mg long-acting injectable risperidone via the deltoid muscle. There will be a washout period of 85 days between each administration of study drug. The primary outcome will be comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters area under the curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) for 37.5 mg deltoid versus 25 mg gluteal, and for 50 mg deltoid versus 50 mg gluteal. Safety will be assessed at screening, throughout the open-label treatment phase, and at the end of study or early withdrawal using a combination of adverse events (including occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms as assessed by the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale), clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and pregnancy testing), vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and injection site evaluation. The study hypothesis is that intramuscular injections of long-acting injectable risperidone via the gluteal and deltoid sites will be bioequivalent routes of administration, as measured by peak and total drug concentrations in the plasma, and that the safety and tolerability profiles of the 2 injection sites will be comparable. The patients will receive a single injection of long--acting injectable risperidone (25 mg, 37.5 mg or 50 mg) in their gluteal or deltoid muscle in 2 treatment periods., Schizophrenia|Risperidone|Long-acting injectable|Intramuscular injection|Pharmacokinetics",2
"Brain Activation Patterns in Schizophrenia After Computerized Cognitive Skills Training, Abnormalities in the domains of attention, working memory (WM) and information processing are important features of schizophrenia. There is growing literature that cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) can produce modest improvements in cognitive functioning in schizophrenia, suggesting that systematic efforts at improving cognitive functioning are feasible. Cognitive improvement after CRT may correlate with changes in brain activation patterns in specific areas.||After screening, patients are randomized to a 12 week trial of CRT using COGPACK (Marker Software), or to a 12-week control condition. All patients attend 3 weekly 1-hour laboratory sessions, with 1 discussion session per week.||Patients continue their antipsychotic treatment with a typical or atypical antipsychotic during the CRT and 4 weeks prior to enrollment in the study (Phase A).

"Assessing a WeChat-based Integrative Family Intervention (WIFI) for Schizophrenia, The investigators will conduct a type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to test both the effect of and the implementation process of a WeChat-based integrative family intervention (WIFI) program. The program will include three core components: 1) psycho-education through WeChat Official Account (WOA), 2) peer support through WeChat chat group, and 3) professional support through WeChat video chat. A rigorous stepped wedge cluster randomized trial will be used to evaluate the implementation, effectiveness, and cost of the WIFI program. The WIFI program will be implemented in 12 communities affiliated with the Changsha psychiatric hospital through the free medicine delivery process in the 686 Program. 20 families of schizophrenia will be selected from each community. The 12 communities will be randomized to one of four fixed sequences every two months during an 8-month intervention period in four clusters of 3 communities each. All clusters will receive the usual financial benefit of the Reward Policy as the control condition, and then successively and in random order, will cross over to the WIFI program at 2-month intervals until the study ends. Outcomes will be assessed for both family caregivers and the family member with schizophrenia. Family caregivers will be assessed for their knowledge and skills about caregiving, social support and coping, perceived stigma, caregiver burden, family functioning, positive feelings, and psychological distress. Schizophrenia individuals will be assessed for their symptoms and functioning, quality of life, recovery and re-hospitalization. Cost data such as costs of the intervention, health care utilization, and costs associated with lost productivity will also be collected. In addition, the investigators will collect process data including fidelity and quality of program implementation as well as users' attitudes will also be collected.

"A Multi-Site Study of Strategies for Implementing Schizophrenia Guidelines, Background:||Schizophrenia, a chronic psychiatric disorder, is the second most frequent VA discharge diagnosis. Medication management practices for schizophrenia often are not guideline-concordant and place patients at risk for adverse outcomes. This project tests a new strategy to standard implementation for VHA Schizophrenia Guidelines.||Objectives:||Research objectives are: (1) to compare the effectiveness of a conceptually-based, enhanced intervention to that of a basic educational strategy with regard to improving guideline adherence and patient compliance; (2) to compare the effectiveness of the two strategies with regard to improving symptom and side effect outcomes; (3) to determine the effect of the enhanced intervention on service utilization for acute exacerbations of schizophrenia; (4) to determine the extent to which guideline-concordant medication management improves patient outcomes; and (5) to examine providers' knowledge of and attitudes toward guidelines.||Methods:||Thirteen VA sites were considered for the study, and VistA data were extracted to assess baseline guideline performance.

"Social Cognition and Interaction Training for Improving Social Functioning in People With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a serious mental condition that affects approximately 1.1% of adults in the United States. People with schizophrenia experience reality perception impairments, which most commonly manifest as hallucinations, extreme paranoia, social withdrawal, and disordered thinking. Deficits in social functioning are a core feature of schizophrenia. In an effort to improve social functioning, there has been growing interest in identifying factors that underlie psychosocial impairments. One such identified factor has been neurocognition, but treatments that target solely cognitive processes do not always help overall social functioning. Social cognition and interaction training (SCIT), a group-based treatment that aims to improve both processing social information and functioning, may be an effective treatment for enhancing the social skills of people with schizophrenia. This study will compare the effectiveness of SCIT versus treatment as usual (TAU) in helping people with schizophrenia improve their social cognition and social functioning.||Participation in this single-blind study will last 11 months. All potential participants will undergo initial screening, involving the completion of a few brief tasks testing social functioning. Eligible participants will then be randomly assigned to receive SCIT plus TAU or TAU alone. Participants assigned to receive SCIT will attend twenty 1-hour weekly group sessions over 5 months. During these sessions, participants will learn ways to manage emotions, work through problems, and integrate into social situations. Participants assigned to TAU alone will meet with their case managers and healthcare provider on an as-needed basis. All participants will undergo assessments of social cognition, social functioning, and psychotic symptoms prior to treatment, immediately post-treatment, and 6 months after treatment.

"A Study of the Effectiveness and Safety of Galantamine Hydrobromide on Cognitive Impairment in Patients With Schizophrenia., Galantamine acts on acetylcholinesterase, and has been shown to effectively treat cognitive symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Previous cellular research of nicotinic receptors has shown promising results, and it is theorized that the nicotinic system of patients with schizophrenia may be abnormal and may play an important role in the cognitive symptoms associated with schizophrenia. It is also postulated that galantamine may improve neuropsychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and apathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Atypical antipsychotic medications are effective treatment for schizophrenia patients but some symptoms remain. Therefore, galantamine may be a useful cotreatment for schizophrenia patients on atypical antipsychotic treatment. This is a pilot dose-ranging, randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance), double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo is being taken, or at what dosage), placebo-controlled multicenter study that examines the effects of taking extended-release galantamine hydrobromide (16 or 24 mg once daily) or placebo on the effectiveness in reducing symptoms of schizophrenia patients who are already taking an atypical antipsychotic medication. The safety of combined treatment is also examined. Measures of effectiveness include the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) to measure neuropsychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia; the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale to measure change over the course of the study; the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) for verbal memory and learning, working memory, motor function, attention, verbal fluency, and executive functioning; the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) for sustained attention and distractability; reaction time test (RTT) and finger tapping test (FTT) for psychomotor speed; Lexical and Semantic Fluency Test (LSFT) for language skills. As schizophrenia patients are a population with high nicotine use, and galantamine may act on nicotine receptors, blood levels of nicotine are also measured as varying nicotine levels could alter the effects of galantamine. The null hypothesis that there is no difference between the 2 groups (galantamine cotreatment and placebo) will be tested for each of the efficacy measurements (total PANSS, BACS, and CGI scores) at Week 8. Measures of safety include physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests, measurement of plasma prolactin concentrations, pregnancy test for women, and incidence of adverse events. Adverse events that might be related to the medications are also monitored using the Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Side Effects Scale (SAS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS).

"TMS Enhancement of Visual Plasticity in Schizophrenia, Learning and memory impairments are commonly observed in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Alterations in ""long-term potentiation"" (LTP), a basic mechanism underlying learning and memory, may explain this impairment. This project will assess fMRI visual plasticity, thought to reflect LTP, in participants with and without schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Previous studies have shown that visual plasticity is impaired in schizophrenia. The major goal is to determine if Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) enhances visual plasticity in schizophrenia. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a non-invasive means for altering brain electrical neural activity. TMS sessions (sham/placebo and real TMS) will be conducted before two MRI scans with two weeks in-between to assess whether TMS stimulation to the visual cortex will enhance visual plasticity in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.

"Evaluation of Effectiveness and Safety of Paliperidone ER (Extended-release) Compared With Quetiapine in Patients With Schizophrenia, This is a randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance), double blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo is being taken, or at what dosage), placebo controlled, parallel group study to compare the efficacy and safety of paliperidone ER with quetiapine in the treatment of patients who have schizophrenia and are acutely ill. The duration of the study is 42 days. During the first phase (Day 0 - Day 14) patients receive increasing doses of the treatment to which they are assigned (starting with 3mg and increasing to 9 mg or 12 mg of paliperidone ER; starting with 50 mg and increasing to 600 mg or 800 mg of quetiapine; or the same number of capsules of placebo). During the second phase (Day 15 - Day 42), patients continue to take the dose of medication they received on day 14, but may also receive other medications if the investigator determines they are needed to treat ongoing symptoms. The hypothesis of the study is that paliperidone ER is better than quetiapine in the short term for treating acutely ill patients with schizophrenia. Primary outcome is change on the total score of the PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome scale for Schizophrenia) in the first phase of the study (Day 0 - Day 14). Secondary outcomes include time to response, time to readiness for discharge, and additional medication use in the second phase of the study (Day 15- Day 42) for patients receiving paliperidone ER compared to quetiapine. Safety of paliperidone ER compared with quetiapine throughout the study (Day 0 - Day 42) will be based on reported adverse events, results of laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, and weight), electrocardiogram, and movement disorder scales (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale, and Simpson-Angus Rating Scale). Patients may participate in a pharmacogenomic (DNA) analysis, if they choose to do so. Patients receive study drug by mouth for a total of 42 days. Study medications will be increased to maximum tolerated doses of Paliperidone ER 9mg or 12mg/day and Quetiapine 600mg or 800mg at day 8. From day 15 through day 42 (end of study) all patients will be eligible for additional psychotropic medications at investigators' discretion., Schizophrenia|Antipsychotic|paliperidone|quetiapine|Seroquel|placebo",2

"A Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of Paliperidone Palmitate in Patients With Schizophrenia, This is an open-label (identity and dose of study drug will be known to patients), safety and pharmacokinetic study of the highest dose (150 mg equivalent) of paliperidone palmitate (referred to as study drug) administered by intramuscular (IM) injection (injection into the muscle) in patients with schizophrenia. A total of at least 200 adult patients with schizophrenia will participate in the study. The study will consist of 2 phases: an up-to-21-day screening period and a 53-week open-label treatment period including an end of study/withdrawal visit. The total duration of the study will be approximately 56 weeks. At the screening visit, if a patient has been treated with an antipsychotic medication before study entry, the medication may be continued during the study except for protocol-specified medications that are not permitted. If patients have not received previous treatment with at least 2 oral (by mouth) doses of the antipsychotic agents risperidone or paliperidone or 1 dose of injectable RISPERDAL CONSTA or paliperidone palmitate, they will undergo a 4-day evaluation period and receive a 6 mg/day oral dose of an extended-release (ER) formulation of paliperidone to evaluate their ability to tolerate study drug. Patients who are able to tolerate study drug and meet all other entry criteria for the study will then be administered a single IM injection into the deltoid muscle (upper arm) of paliperidone palmitate 150 mg equivalent (eq) on Day 1 (Treatment A). Patients who tolerate Treatment A will receive a 2nd IM injection in the deltoid muscle of 150 mg eq on Day 8 followed by 150 mg eq administered by IM injection in the deltoid or gluteal (buttocks) muscle once every 4 weeks for the remainder of the 53-week treatment period. Patients who do not tolerate Treatment A or who do not wish to have multiple blood samples collected for pharmacokinetic testing will be assigned to Treatment B. Patients who do not tolerate Treatment A will receive a single IM injection of study drug 100 mg eq at their next scheduled visit followed by a flexible dose schedule of study drug ranging from 50 to 150 mg eq administered by IM injection in the deltoid or gluteal muscle every 4 weeks for the remainder of the 53-week treatment period. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics (ie, to test the concentration of study drug in the blood) will be collected at specified times before and after each dose of study drug from all patients; additional blood samples for pharmacokinetic testing will be collected from patients receiving Treatment A. An additional blood sample may also be collected at any time during screening or before the first day of IM administration of study drug for patients who agree to participate in an optional part of the study called a pharmacogenomic evaluation (genetic testing) for possible use in characterizing the safety and/or efficacy of study drug in relation to the pharmacogenic (genetic) profile of the patient. Periodically during the study, patients will be assessed for the presence of psychiatric symptoms and severity of symptoms. The safety and tolerability of paliperidone will be evaluated by monitoring adverse events (side effects) and relevant changes in laboratory values, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs measurements, physical examinations, and extrapyramidal symptoms (ie, symptoms that can be associated with taking antipsychotic drugs) scores reported from the time of screening to the end of the study (Day 372 or at the time of the patient's early termination from the study). The concentration of paliperidone in plasma (colorless portion of blood) from blood samples collected from Day 1 through to the end of the study will also be determined. Since only limited information exists regarding the repeated administration of doses of paliperidone palmitate, an internal review board will meet 2 times during the study to review safety data collected. The first review of safety data will be performed after approximately 30 patients complete 99 days of treatment and the second review of safety data will be made after approximately 75 patients complete 176 days of treatment. After each review of safety data, the safety review board will make a recommendation to continue the study, modify the protocol, or to terminate the study.

"Brief Anxiety Skills Training Intervention for Veterans in Primary Care, Background/Rationale: Many Veteran primary care patients experience impairing symptoms of anxiety, but rates of behavioral treatment are low. Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PCMHI), in which mental health clinicians embedded in primary care provide brief treatment, affords an opportunity to address this treatment gap. However, behavioral interventions that are compatible with the brief PCMHI treatment format and able to accommodate a wide range of anxiety presentations are needed. Accordingly, Veterans Anxiety Skills Training (VAST) was designed to be evidence-based, transdiagnostic, feasible for PCMHI, and Veteran-centered. VAST consists of empirically-supported cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques adapted into a manualized modular intervention specifically designed for delivery in PCMHI.||Objectives: The specific aims of this study are to: (1) Compare patient clinical outcomes for VAST vs. PCMHI usual care between baseline and 16 weeks (post), and also examine whether treatment gains are more likely to be maintained for VAST vs. PCMHI usual care at 28 weeks (follow-up); (2) For participants receiving VAST, explore patient-level predictors of (a) early (8 weeks) and (b) overall (16 weeks) treatment response; and (3) Conduct a mixed-methods process evaluation of VAST implementation to examine rates of, barriers to, and facilitators of achieving and sustaining high-fidelity intervention delivery.||Methods: In this multi-site, hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation randomized clinical trial, 178 adult Veterans with elevated anxiety symptoms will be recruited from primary care at the Syracuse and Western New York VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PCMHI providers will be randomized to deliver either VAST or usual care (routine PCMHI care, meaning whatever care the provider deems appropriate), and Veteran participants will be randomized to condition. VAST (up to six 30-minute sessions) consists of a standard initial and final session as well as up to 4 cognitive-behavioral skills modules. The primary outcome (Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale [OASIS]) and secondary outcomes (anxiety and depressive symptom severity, functioning, quality of life, suicidality) will be assessed at baseline, 16 weeks (post) and 28 weeks (follow-up). Symptom severity and impairment will also be assessed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks as part of Aim 2. The fidelity of VAST delivery by PCMHI providers will be measured and tracked, and VAST providers will complete semi-structured interviews at the beginning and end of the study.||Analytic plan: Multi-level modeling will be used to evaluate the hypothesis that patient clinical outcomes will improve more from baseline to post (16 weeks) for participants receiving VAST compared to PCMHI usual care. The primary analysis will be conducted using the intention-to-treat approach. Multi-level modeling will also be used to examine group differences in the secondary outcomes at post (16 weeks) and the primary outcomes at follow-up (28 weeks). Multivariate logistic regression will be used to explore predictors of early (8 weeks) and overall (16 weeks) VAST treatment response (defined as a decrease of 4 or more points on the OASIS). A mixed-methods process evaluation will examine the proportion of PCMHI providers who achieve and sustain high-fidelity VAST delivery as well as barriers to and facilitators of high-fidelity delivery., anxiety|primary health care|Veterans",0

"Reducing Anxiety and Stress in Primary Care Patients, Background/Rationale: Many Veteran primary care patients experience impairing symptoms of anxiety, but rates of treatment are low. Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI), in which mental health clinicians provide brief treatment in the primary care setting, can bridge the gap between demand for, and availability of, anxiety treatment. However, brief anxiety interventions suitable for use in the PC-MHI setting are needed. Developing an effective brief PC-MHI intervention for anxiety would address a gap in VA treatment options and facilitate high quality healthcare that improves treatment engagement, clinical outcomes, and patient experience. To ensure maximum reach, this intervention should accommodate a variety of subthreshold and diagnostic anxiety presentations, as well as comorbid depression.||Objectives: The overall goal of this research program is to develop, refine, and evaluate a brief anxiety intervention that will be acceptable to Veterans and feasible for PC-MHI providers. The primary aim of the current study is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, potential implementation barriers and facilitators, and effectiveness of the intervention compared to usual care.||Methods: This will be a pilot hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial (N = 35). The primary goal is to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of the intervention in reducing anxiety symptom severity compared to usual care. The secondary goal is to collect preliminary data on implementation barriers and facilitators that may affect future real-world uptake., anxiety|primary health care|Veterans",0

"Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety, Anxiety disorders are identified in over 30% of primary care patients and are associated with substantial functional impairment, poor health-related quality of life, and suicide; however, rates of treatment are low. In contrast to advances in improving treatment of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder in VA, far less attention has been given to anxiety disorders. In the absence of VA clinical practice guidelines for anxiety disorders, evidence-based treatment practices are unstandardized in VA primary care and Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based intervention for the anxiety disorders but was developed for use in specialty mental health settings and often targets individual anxiety disorders (e.g.generalized anxiety, panic, and social phobia) with diagnosis-specific treatment packages. These interventions are not practical for primary care and CBOC settings where treatment must be brief and focused on reduction of anxiety symptoms rather than targeted anxiety diagnoses. Further complicating the delivery of CBT for anxiety disorders is that repeated exposure to feared cues is considered a critical component of CBT for anxiety but is rarely used in these settings. Providers within VA currently have no standardized options for delivering brief evidence-based psychotherapy for Veterans with anxiety. Although Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) and CBOCs increase access to mental health services, VA recognizes the need to deliver mental health services using video to home technology to increase access, decrease barriers (i.e., geographic distance, transportation, travel time, stigma, child care) and provide more Veteran-centric care. VA is pioneering implementation of VA Video Connect to Home (VVC-H) technology in specialty mental health clinics, but VVC-H continues to be rarely used and little is known about the implementation potential of VVC-H to improve psychotherapy access and outcomes in primary care and CBOC settings. In summary, VA needs a flexible evidence-based approach for anxiety that fits within primary care and CBOC settings and offers innovative delivery strategies to increase access to care. Although treatment in PCMHI and CBOC settings must be time-limited, it must also be highly effective. The investigators have developed robust brief CBT (bCBT) interventions and provider support programs for depression and is now seeking to address anxiety using a similar approach. The proposed clinical intervention will use state-of-the-art practices including delivery of services via VVC-H. This open trial seeks to recruit 12 Veterans who have significant anxiety symptoms according to the GAD-7 (standard assessment tool for VA clinical settings). Veterans will be recruited from the Michael E. DeBakey VAMC primary care clinic and affiliated Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs)., brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|VA Video Connect to home",0

"Anxiety Level Assessment of Anesthesia Providers During COVID-19 Pandemic, The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected multiple aspects of everyday life worldwide. Pandemics unleash a societal sense of fear and anxiety. Hence, the COVID-19 pandemic have had a profound impact on mental health. This has led to substantial research on this topic; however, literature evaluating the mental health effects of the pandemic on small groups of people is scarce. Healthcare workers have undergone significant psychological pressure and stress during viral surges of this pandemic. Furthermore, the levels of anxiety vary as the number of cases varies between regions and across time.||After approval by the Institutional Review Board (Protocol # 160167), a cross-sectional study was conducted to identify anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic among anesthesia providers at our institution.

"Teacher Anxiety Program for Elementary Students, Summary, Benefit to Stakeholders, and Aims: Teachers lack the knowledge and skills to support the learning of students with excessive anxiety who have, or at risk of developing, an identified disability. Excessive student anxiety is a common problem that severely impairs short and long term academic functioning and increases teacher burden. Conversely, reducing student anxiety has been associated with improvement in educational functioning. Because anxiety manifests daily in the classroom, teachers are in an ideal position to identify and help students manage their anxiety. One universal intervention for anxiety reduction exists, but its feasibility and efficacy are not established. The aims of this project are to address this gap in teacher training. Specifically, the aims of this proposal include: Aim 1) to develop the Teacher Anxiety Program for Elementary Students (TAPES) and assess its usability, acceptability and feasibility; Aim 2) to determine whether teachers can implement TAPES with high fidelity and quality; Aim 3) to examine the impact of TAPES, compared to a standard professional development condition, on teacher a) knowledge and b) use of anxiety reduction strategies with students with excessive anxiety (Primary Outcomes); and Aim 4) to examine the impact of TAPES on student outcomes. Exploratory aims will examine the mediators, predictors, and moderators of TAPES impact on teachers' knowledge and skill. If effective, TAPES has the potential to directly benefit: 1) teachers--by providing training in an important and relevant, but neglected area that will enhance their professional development and effectiveness in the classroom; and 2) children--by reducing their anxiety and improving their educational, social, and behavioral functioning.||Description of TAPES: The proposed teacher training is appropriate for elementary teachers to enhance their capacity to support students with excessive anxiety. The training includes one full day of instruction, materials to use with individual students and their parents (in 5 meetings), and guidelines for classroom-wide strategies to reduce anxiety. The section below describes 1) the content of the teacher training and supportive empirical evidence, 2) how this training differs from current teacher practices for anxious students, 3) a proposed theory of teacher and child behavior change and 4) evidence supporting the feasibility of implementing TAPES in an authentic school environment. This teacher training is not intended to replace or change the role of existing mental health providers or other members of schools' interdisciplinary teams. Given that teachers are members of an interdisciplinary team, the study team will obtain input from school personnel to ensure that the teacher-training fits within the goals/mission of the interdisciplinary team.||Description of TAPES content: Overview: The primary goal of TAPES is to enhance teachers' capacity to identify and reduce anxiety in their students. Toward this end, the proposed content of TAPES consists of three core components: 1) training in evidenced-based anxiety reduction strategies that teachers will implement to identify and assist specific anxious students and classroom-wide strategies helpful to all students, 2) evidenced-based material for teachers to review with parents regarding how to reduce student anxiety at home, thus improving school-home communication and shared goals and 3) training in how to conduct conjoint teacher-parent-student meetings to improve the quality of the teacher-parent-student relationship. Each component is described below.||Training and Evidence Related to Child Anxiety Reduction Skills: Teachers will learn skills based on cognitive behavioral strategies (CBT) including relaxation training (to reduce physiological arousal), behavioral strategies (e.g., ""exposure"" or facing anxiety provoking situations which lowers anxiety via new learning), addressing maladaptive thoughts that maintain anxiety, and problem solving skills. To implement these new skills with specific children teachers will be trained to use a school-home journal that includes a type of daily report card that tracks behavioral exposures and use a reward system for increasing brave behavior /adaptive coping skills.). These ""common elements"" of CBT are powerful agents of change and have been implemented by CBT experts and non-experts. As such, these skills are established and empirically-supported; however, they have not been evaluated when delivered by teachers.||Teachers will also receive training in effective classroom-based accommodations that may be needed (e.g. untimed testing) or may need to be gradually faded if they are maintaining anxiety through negative reinforcement (e.g. allowing child to avoid participating in class due to anxiety). Another component of the teacher training includes skills that teachers deliver to their classroom (i.e., such as leading the entire class in a relaxation exercise prior to an exam; teacher using a coping model or teacher reducing their accommodation of avoidant/anxious behavior for all students). Finally, teachers will be trained in how to modify their own behaviors that have been shown to increase student anxiety (e.g., hostility, over-control). These modifications are also designed to improve the quality of the teacher-student relationship. Research on the role of teacher behavior in the development and/or maintenance of child anxiety suggests that teachers who exhibit highly controlling behaviors, such as issuing frequent directives, tend to increase child anxiety and negatively affect children's ability to learn. Conversely, positive teacher-child relationships have been found to protect youth from developing internalizing behavior problems over time. Consequently, TAPES aims to modify these teacher behaviors.||Training and Evidence Related to Conjoint Parent-Teacher-Student Meetings. Training teachers in conducting conjoint meetings will enhance teachers' ability to formalize mechanisms for sharing information about anxiety reduction and will enhance communication and relationship quality between parent, teacher, and student. Training in these conjoint meeting will also allow the teacher to clarify roles and responsibilities with respect to helping the child, and devise a collaborative plan with similar language and tools to facilitate generalization of skills between school and home. Implementation of this component will involve approximately 5 conjoint-30 minute meetings over an 8 week period. During these meetings, parents, students, and teachers will create and modify anxiety hierarchies, mutually decide on practice tasks, and develop a contingency management plan. Target behaviors are individualized based on the needs of the child (e.g., raising a hand to answer a question in class for a child with social anxiety; separating from parents for a child with separation anxiety). These meetings can be supplemented by phone and email contacts between teacher and parents/students as needed.||TAPES Training Format and Implementation: Students' primary teacher will participate in a one-day training (approximately 6 hours). One of the most important strategies for ensuring that TAPES is implemented with high fidelity is appropriate training and ongoing consultation. Training strategies will be based on published guidelines and will include active/experiential learning strategies, opportunities for observation (via video clips), live modeling and role plays, and coached practice. Ongoing performance feedback and consultation has been found to enhance learning and is related to higher fidelity. Thus, teachers will be offered 30-minutes of weekly consultation by the PIs for each active TAPES students. Consultation will include case review, skill rehearsal, problem-solving obstacles, and feedback regarding performance based on audiotaped sessions. Meetings will be held in person, over the phone, or via Skype at times convenient for teachers. After each teacher identifies their first child, the PIs will attend one conjoint meeting in order to provide performance feedback (all conjoint meetings are audiotaped for fidelity). The PIs will also provide in classroom coaching for 30-minutes for each student enrolled. Training materials will be available on the internet or thumb drive for reference.||Research Plan Overview: Design and Methods. This three-year development project consists of 3 stages. Stage one (months 1-6) involves establishing a Development Team (DT) that will review the initial draft of TAPES and provide feedback to ensure that TAPES is acceptable to teachers and feasible for the school setting. Stage two (months 7-20) involves two successive open trials of the TAPES protocol with 15 teachers and 20 children. This stage will allow for ""trial runs"" of the training to assess feasibility, acceptability and utility of the training. Data and qualitative feedback gleaned during the first open trial will inform modifications for the second open trial. The investigators will present and discuss data with the DT after each open trial. Study staff will also ask 5 teachers from open trial 1 to test out the revisions for open trial 2. Based on knowledge gained in this stage, appropriate modifications will be made for stage three. Stage three (months 21-34) involves a pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) using a randomized controlled design comparing TAPES to the Teacher Anxiety Training (TAT). TAT (developed by the PIs for use in other studies and described below) will be used to represent ""typical"" teacher professional development training. The RCT will be conducted in three phases. Phase 1 consists of recruiting, randomizing, and training teachers in either TAPES or TAT. Also during this phase (but after the training), teachers will recruit anxious children and study staff will screen and evaluate them to determine eligibility. In Phase 2 teachers will implement TAPES or TAT. Phase 3 involves a post-intervention (after 8 weeks) and a three-month follow-up assessment of the primary (teacher behavior) and secondary (child) outcomes. Trained independent evaluators (IEs) will assess primary outcomes (teacher behavior). The culmination of these iterative stages will be a final version of the training that will be ready for evaluation in a larger efficacy trial.||Detailed Description of Each Stage Stage 1: Establish DT and refine initial version of the TAPES Protocol. The DT will strive to ensure that the teacher training will be acceptable, feasible, and usable in the school setting. The DT will consist of the PIs, two national experts in teacher training, two experts in school-home collaborative interventions, and two experts in training school-based personnel in CBT techniques for anxious youth. A CT school psychologist and two CT elementary teachers will complete the DT. DT members will provide detailed feedback about the TAPES strategies, study methods/measures, perceived barriers to successful implementation and adoption by teachers, and solutions to potential barriers. Information from this meeting will be used to revise the protocol in preparation for the first open trial as well as successive phases of the study.||Stage 2: Open Trials. During Stage 2, teachers and IEs will be trained, and the study team will conduct two sequential open trials. Study staff will engage in screening activities of students and IEs will complete baseline evaluations on referred students. The purpose of the open trials is to evaluate the feasibility of the training, modify methods as needed, allow teachers to implement the skills learned in the training and receive real time coaching and consultation with anxious children. Data on TAPES usability, acceptability, fidelity, satisfaction, and teacher and child outcomes will also be collected. After each open trial, feedback (via exit interviews and standardized measures) from teachers, students, and parents will be integrated by the research team and presented to the DT for another revision of the protocol. Teachers will be asked to participate in an exit interview after they implement TAPES with an anxious child.||Stage 3: Pilot RCT. In stage 3, the study team will conduct a pilot RCT with 40 teachers and a maximum of 60 anxious youth. The RCT will be conducted in 3 phases.||Phase 1 - Recruitment, Randomization, Training, Student Screening, and Baseline Evaluations: In Phase 1, teachers will be randomly selected from the pool of interested participants and randomized to TAPES or TAT. Once randomized, teachers will complete their assigned training. Teachers will then identify potentially eligible students from their classes and provide information about the study to their parents. Interested parents will contact study staff and complete a brief phone screen. Students who appear eligible based on the phone screen (e.g., have elevated anxiety; are in elementary school) will be invited to complete informed consent and a full baseline evaluation with an IE. Families who meet criteria on the baseline evaluation will be considered eligible (see Inclusion/Exclusion criteria).||Phase 2 - TAPES/TAT Implementation: Teachers will implement TAPES or TAT depending on their random assignment over 8 weeks from child enrollment.||Phase 3 - Post- and Follow-up Evaluations: At the end of the 8 weeks, teachers and children in both groups will complete a post evaluation. Teachers, students, and parents will complete a TAPES satisfaction measure and provide feedback to enhance the protocol. Teachers will complete an exit interview. Students who need mental health services will be referred to the school counselor or community provider for treatment. A 3 month follow-up evaluation to assess sustained use of TAPES/TAT skills will be conducted., Excessive Anxiety|Teacher Training|Elementary School|School-based|Effectiveness Research|Randomized Controlled Trial",0

"Anxiety Levels in Adolescents Undergoing Endoscopy, Although anxiety is known to be a disorder that is much more relevant for adults, it is seen at a frequency of approximately 6.5% in the childhood and adolescence. Anxiety is usually examined in two different forms, state anxiety and trait anxiety. A total of 180 pediatric patients who underwent GIS endoscopy in our hospital were included in our study. Demographic data (age, gender, height, weight, educational status, school and grade), additional diseases and diagnoses were recorded. Our aim was to evaluate the anxiety and trait anxiety levels of adolescents scheduled for gastrointestinal system (GIS) endoscopy under sedation, after being admitted as a single-day inpatient and before the procedure. A form evaluating state and trait anxiety levels (Spielberger's state and trait anxiety scale) and another form consisting of demographic data were given to the patients. We requested that the forms be filled by the children themselves. After monitoring in the endoscopy unit, sedation was applied with IV anesthetic drugs routinely.Oxygenation was provided with nasal O2 in all patients. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) were monitored. Also complications (bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, decrease in SpO2, apnea) were recorded., Adolescent|anxiety|endoscopy|anesthesia",0
"A Study Comparing Two Treatments for Child With Anxiety, Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders in children and typically produce significant disruption in family, social, and academic functioning (Merikangas & Avenevoli, 2002). Fortunately, treatments for childhood anxiety have been manualized and found to be efficacious (Walkup, et al., 2008). These treatments most often incorporate aspects of cognitive-restructuring, relaxation training, and exposure to anxiety-producing stimuli. Unfortunately, many practitioners opt to utilize mainly cognitive and relaxation techniques at the expense of exposure techniques (Freiheit, Vye, Swan, & Cady, 2004). However, it remains unclear which of these components is most effective in reducing anxiety symptoms or the extent to which they act in concert; thus, the relative effectiveness of treatment for childhood anxiety when leaving-out a treatment component is unknown. The current study aims to compare the relative effectiveness of exposure therapy for childhood anxiety to cognitive restructuring and relaxation techniques. Sixty children and adolescents seeking treatment for anxiety in an outpatient pediatric anxiety clinic will be randomized to receive either six sessions of parent assisted exposure therapy or six sessions of individual cognitive restructuring and relaxation training. Comprehensive assessments will be completed by trained clinicians at pre-treatment and again at post-treatment to measure reductions in anxiety and related symptoms as well as improvements in daily functioning. We anticipate that children treated with exposure therapy will demonstrate significantly greater improvement over the six sessions than children treated with cognitive-restructuring and relaxation training, and will require fewer additional treatment sessions. Support of this hypthothesis would clarify the active ingredients in manualized treatment for childhood anxiety disorders and would potentially lead to quicker, more efficient treatment., child|anxiety|CBT",0
"Group Therapy Intervention for Children and Adolescents With Injection-Related Anxiety and Their Caregivers, The proposed intervention protocol is a modification of an existing empirically developed treatment (Self-Injection Anxiety Counseling) for adults with injection related anxiety who rely on self-injection for illness management (Mohr, Cox, & Boudewyn, 2003). Self-Injection Anxiety Counseling (SIAC) was developed to assist psychologists and medical staff in working with patients individually to develop strategies to reduce anxiety and increase an individual's ability to self-inject. This treatment protocol has been found to result in increased self injection in patients who experienced injection anxiety prior to undergoing this treatment (Mohr, Cox, & Merluzzi, 2005). Permission has been obtained from Dr. Mohr to modify this treatment manual to be applied to youth in group setting.||This modified group protocol consists of five group sessions. The goals of the first session include development of a group identity, psychoeducation, and physiological treatment of anxiety though the instruction and practice of relaxation techniques. The second session introduces a cognitive component to anxiety reduction and focuses on unhelpful thoughts and strategies youth and caregivers can use to counteract these thoughts. The third session implements the previously learned physiological and cognitive treatments through in vivo injection practice. A registered nurse skilled in working with youth and caregivers on self-injection will be present and active throughout this session and all infection control procedures will be followed. Problem solving strategies are implemented in the fourth session to reduce any difficulties encountered by participants as they practiced their injection goal throughout the week. The fifth session will occur two weeks after the fourth session. This extra week between sessions allows for additional practice and problem solving related to injection goals. The last session reviews problem solving strategies and celebrates the success of participants.||Relevant outcomes for hypotheses testing will be measured before treatment, after completion of treatment, and at follow-up; one measure of injection-related anxiety will be utilized more frequently throughout the treatment., anxiety|injection|needle|pediatric|youth|children|adolescents|cognitive behavioral|behavioral|exposure|group|treatment|chronic illness|adherence",0
"Happy Mother - Healthy Baby: Supplement Study on Biological Processes Underlying Anxiety During Pregnancy, This study will leverage the ongoing randomized evaluation of the CBT anxiety prevention intervention in Pakistan (R01-MH111859) to explore potential biological mechanisms. This CBT intervention targets both sub-threshold anxiety symptoms and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in early- to mid- pregnancy, aiming to both prevent and treat Common Mental Disorders (CMDs) (GAD and major depressive episodes (MDE)) as well as improve birth outcomes. The study team proposes to additionally study biological correlates of antenatal anxiety (i.e., immune and endocrine functioning) in 300 women: in addition to 200 drawn from our randomized trial (100 intervention, 100 usual care), the study will also include 100 healthy women without anxiety or depression. The aims are to 1) characterize the ""immune phenotype"" of anxious women across the peripartum, specifically by measuring the relation among anxiety symptoms and peripheral markers of inflammation within and across women (both anxious and healthy) and between those receiving the intervention and control; 2) determine the relation between levels of allopregnanolone (ALLO) in pregnancy and concurrent anxiety symptoms and future symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD), 3) examine the relation between changes in immune functioning and ALLO levels in anxious pregnancy across time, 4) examine whether immune function and/or ALLO are mediators or moderators of the association between antenatal anxiety and preterm birth and/or small-for-gestational age, and 5) examine the effects of both anxiety and the intervention (including biomarkers) on infant development at six weeks postpartum., randomized controlled trial|inflammation|hormones",0
"Attention Bias Modification for Anxiety: A Randomized Control Trial With Biomarkers, Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric diagnosis, affecting as many as 29% of people during their lifetime. In addition to the devastating personal cost of anxiety, the yearly economic cost to society has been estimated to be around $46.6 billion in the U.S. Empirically-based treatments for anxiety have improved in recent years, but barriers to access, side effects, and high remission rates (~50%) suggest the need for complementary treatments. Computer-based attention bias modification treatment (ABMT), which is brief, cost-effective, and easy to administer, targets a key mechanism in pathological anxiety - the threat bias, or exaggerated attention feared or threatening stimuli. Two decades of research show that reducing threat bias via computerized ABMT also reduces anxiety severity at levels comparable to gold-standard treatments. Despite its promise, no randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have evaluated specific mechanisms underlying ABMT's effects on anxiety, nor identified predictors of treatment response. Therefore, it remains unclear how and for whom ABMT is effective, limiting clinical translation. This study is a randomized clinical trial using a highly sensitive measure of neurocognitive functioning to delineate key mechanisms of an emerging treatment for anxiety. Specifically, the study will use scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) to elucidate neurocognitive processes implicated in attention bias modification treatment (ABMT) and to predict treatment response. Researchers will recruit 90 anxious patients to engage in the study and pursue the following three specific aims: Aim 1 will examine relations between neural and behavioral responses to threat prior to ABMT. Researchers will test whether greater behavioral threat bias is associated with ERP responses indicating greater attention capture by threat (larger P1 and P2 ERPs), and reduced top-down control of attention to threat (smaller N2, N2pc, P3 ERPs). Aim 2 will examine the effects of ABMT on ERPs to threat, threat bias, and anxiety. Analyses will focus on whether ABMT relative to placebo training will result in greater reductions in automatic attention capture and/or controlled attention to threat measured via ERPs. Aim 3 will examine relations between ERP responses to threat and reductions in threat bias and anxiety. Researchers will test whether post-training neural changes, specified in Aim 2, will be associated with reductions in behavioral threat bias and anxiety severity. These predicted relations,together with those tested in Aim 2a, support the utility of these ERPs as neural markers for the specific cognitive processes underlying ABMT efficacy. Researchers will also explore whether ERP measures of greater attention capture and/or reduced control of attention to threat at baseline predict treatment response, helping identify which patients will benefit most from ABMT. Through the innovative combination of a highly sensitive neurocognitive measure and an RCT design, this proposal aims to delineate core neurocognitive responses to threat as mechanisms in the remediation of anxiety. Confirmation of study hypotheses would, ultimately, accelerate the pace of development of more biologically-informed, accessible, and targeted interventions for anxiety., attention bias modification, anxiety, event-related potentials",0
"Anxiety Reduction Treatment for Acute Trauma, The purpose of the proposed research is to pilot a behavioral intervention specifically designed to reduce the symptoms of peritraumatic panic, in order to reduce the likelihood of subsequent PTSD. The investigators have developed the Anxiety Reduction Treatment for Acute Trauma (ARTAT), a one-session intervention targeting at-risk individuals (those continuing to experience peritraumatic panic following a trauma) and enhance self-efficacy. The intervention provides education about common responses to trauma in order to normalize symptoms and teaches individuals anxiety management techniques such as deep breathing and muscle relaxation. ARTAT specifically avoids encouraging people to process the trauma (given evidence that this may enhance arousal).||This study is a randomized controlled trial of a single session 60- minute Anxiety Reduction Treatment for Acute Trauma (ARTAT) administered during Emergency Department (ED) admission to patients presenting with anxiety following traumatic exposure. Thirty-six participants will be enrolled over a 12-month period (18 receiving ARTAT and 18 receiving TAU). The study will target anxious arousal in patients immediately (1 to 8 hours) following a trauma. Participants will be recruited from among patients who present in the Bellevue Emergency Department for treatment of an injury sustained in a traumatic event (accident, assault) as long as injuries do not preclude participation. Participants included in the study will have experienced a trauma within 8 hours and presenting with signs of a strong risk factor for PTSD: peritraumatic panic (severe psychological and physiological anxiety symptoms such as fear of dying, fear of losing emotional control, tachycardia, sweating, shaking and dissociation symptoms such as derealisation and depersonalization that occur during and immediately following a trauma. Following the initial assessment, eligible participants will be randomized to receive the one-hour anxiety-reduction intervention designed to reduce anxiety and panic symptoms through education and anxiety y management skills or the TAU.

"Use of Alpha-Stim Cranial-electrotherapy Stimulation (CES) in the Treatment of Anxiety, The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Alpha-Stim technology in the treatment of anxiety by using a double-blind clinical trial over a period of five weeks. Cranial-electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is a noninvasive procedure that has been used for decades in the United States to treat anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Although many studies on CES have been published in previous decades, most have used relatively small samples using various frequencies and links of treatment. Given the positive results of the many general studies that have been performed to date, this study seeks to add to the current literature by addressing previous criticisms using a large sample size (n=150)and using participants that represent more than a single type of anxiety along with comorbidity. Such a population is believed to better represent typical treatment complications.||Participants will be recruited via advertisements in a local newspaper and posting of flyers around a local university campus. Participants will be screened through an intake process using the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) to confirm a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Comorbid conditions are acceptable, however, an anxiety disorder must be the primary diagnosis. As part of the intake process, participants will complete the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) to establish a baseline. These instruments will serve as the primary efficacy measures. In order to participate, HAM-A scores must equal to or greater than 18 (Moderate Anxiety). Depression will be monitored using The HAM-D17 as depression is a commonly occurring condition with anxiety and the HAM-D17 is also sensitive to anxiety. Current treatment with medications are also acceptable provided there will be no changes in dosage or type during the study. See Inclusions and Exclusions for further information. All participants will pay a fee of $30 to enter the study to cover administration costs and as a way to measure placebo effect. Participants will be assigned a device to take home and self-administer treatment 5-7 days a week. Participants will be required to log their treatment times and dates with logs provided by the researcher. The student population will not be given a take home device but will receive treatment at the Graduate Assistant's Office or Student Care Office.||Electromedical Products International, Inc. has agreed to supply the devices needed to carry out the research to include conductance solution, felt tabs, and batteries. Half of the devices will be set by the manufacturer to deliver treatment at 0.5 Hz and at the lowest therapeutic setting. The remaining devices will be shame and not deliver any therapeutic benefit. The devices will not be able to be altered by the participant.||Participants will meet with the PI or research assistant to complete the HAM-A and HAM-D17 at weeks 1, 3, and 5 at a designated location either in the researchers private practice office or university lab location. Adverse treatment reactions will also be noted. Treatment logs will also be collected at these points. At weeks 1 and 3, participants will be given fresh batteries, conductance solution, and felt tabs as needed. At the completion of the study, participants found to be in the shame treatment group will be offered the normal course of treatment. Participants not wanting to continue the study or do not wish to follow through with normal treatment after being in the shame group will be refunded their fee.||The hypothesis this study seeks to address is:||H°: There is no difference between sham treatment and active CES on level of anxiety as compared to scores on the HAM-A and HAM-D17.||H¹ : The active CES treatment group has significantly lower anxiety scores on the HAM-A and HAM-D17 than the sham group at the endpoint of the study.||Statistical analysis will compare baselines scores (week 1) to midpoint scores (week, 3), and scores at the endpoint of the study (week 5). Response to treatment will be defined as an improvement of 30% or greater on the HAM-A and HAM-D17 at the endpoint of the study. The impact of prescription medication as a confounding variable in relation to the effect of CES on anxiety and depression will also be examined. Data analysis will consist of a repeated measures design that will likely use a general linear model in SPSS and hierarchical linear and quadratic growth models to assess individual change. The reason for this approach is that hierarchical analysis of individual change is advantageous when there are multiple repeated measure data patterns because it affords the research an opportunity to combine into a single analysis (Raudenbush & Byrk, 2002). We will estimate both the individual growth and mean growth for each point in the time series. Cross-validation of quadratic will occur via the estimation of a piecewise linear growth models to assess whether growth is more variable for one period over another during the study time frame.||Optimal design software has been used to make a preliminary determination that 100 or more participants in a randomized quadratic growth individual change model will achieve a power of .80 to .95 for a study expecting an effect size of between 0.6 to .80, respectively (0.62 is premised upon meta-analysis for CES undertaken by Klawansky, et al., 1995 and .8 is considered a large effect by Cohen, 1988). We will employ power analysis again once sample size is confirmed following recruitment of participants and expect upwards of 150 or more participants. Missing data will be explained using an intent-to-treat analysis whereby we employ redundant analysis procedures (i.e., survival analysis) to understand and context the true treatment effect., Anxiety|Anxiety Disorders",0
"The Effects of Dog Intervention on Anxiety Levels in Children Undergoing an MRI Examination, MRI is an imaging method common worldwide, both for adults and children. Studies show, however, that about two thirds of the children undergoing MRI suffer from feelings of anxiety ranging from mild apprehension to severe distress. For very young children, the unfamiliar surroundings, new faces, strange equipment and particularly the noise generated during the scan, can all cause feelings of stress and anxiety so severe that the test either cannot even begin or cannot be performed properly because the child is incapable of lying still. For older children and adults claustrophobia is the main reason of poor image quality because of motion artifacts or early termination of the scan.||Anxiety is a reaction to an unfamiliar situation and its strength is far greater than the objective danger. Anxiety is characterized by subjective feelings of stress and worry that activate the autonomic nervous system.||In recent years, more and more use is made of certain techniques to prepare patients for a wide range of treatments, including methods of preparing patients for the MRI procedure, especially children. The purpose of preparation is to familiarize patients with the equipment and the stages of the imaging procedure. It also enables the technician to answer questions the patient may have and thereby avoid false assumptions about the procedure.||Intervention with animals, dogs in particular, is developing around the world and is being used in a variety of activities in rehabilitation centers, nursing homes, special education schools, hospitals and more.||In 1987 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recognized the field of animal therapy and during the last two decades many reports have been published on the positive effects when patients interact with animals. These reports include: performance improvements, improved physiological measurements, reduction of stress and anxiety, reduced feelings of loneliness and depression, and a more speedy recovery.The animal is seen as a ""friend"" in the strange world of the clinic. Having a companion dog present distracts the patient from the surroundings and procedures.||In a pilot study, conducted in 2001 at the New Jersey hospital, an intervention program with a dog was introduced for reducing anxiety in adults before an MRI. This study has demonstrated that animal-assisted intervention indeed decreases the anxiety levels of patients in a pre MRI setting.||Several studies have demonstrated the potential calming effects of companion animals on children but, to date, no formal studies on the relationship between dog intervention and a child's anxiety before an MRI procedure have been reported. The current study is designed to determine if dog intervention lessens children's anxiety prior to MRI., Anxiety|Dog Intervention|MRI|Children",0

If anxiety increases inflammation, then we predict that ACT will reduce circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, and produce a phenotype of endothelial cell proteins reflecting decreased inflammation compared to pre-treatment.

"Web-based Interpretation Training For Anxiety, Approximately half of the U.S. population experiences serious mental health problems during their lifetime, including 29% with anxiety pathology severe enough to qualify for an anxiety disorder diagnosis [1]. Critically, more than two thirds of individuals struggling with a mental illness do not receive treatment [1]. With this level of mental illness burden, it is clear that treating people one-on-one in an office setting will never meet the existing needs [2]. There are many barriers to treatment, including costs [3], difficulties accessing evidence-based treatments in many regions [4], and associated stigma [5]. Thus, there is a pressing need to consider alternative, larger scale approaches to delivering mental health services. Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) interventions hold considerable promise as a way to meet these needs, especially for anxiety difficulties [6]. These computer-based programs are designed to alter biased ways of thinking, such as a tendency toward negative interpretations, which cause and maintain anxiety [6]. Because these programs do not require therapist contact and can be administered on any computer with an Internet connection, CBM holds promise as a cost-effective method that can be disseminated widely. However, while CBM for interpretation bias (CBM-I) has established efficacy when administered in-person in the laboratory [7], it now needs to be tested with broader populations using a web-based infrastructure to examine: a) whether the program will be effective in a web environment, b) whether the program continues to engage the targeted mechanism (i.e., interpretation bias), c) the feasibility of this delivery method, and d) the modifications needed to adapt the program for the web (in particular, to prime anxiety-linked negative thinking in an online environment, we test the effect of adding a guided anxious imagery exercise to prime feared outcomes prior to each training session).||Together, the current proposal will develop an infrastructure to pilot test the effectiveness of web-based CBM-I for anxiety symptoms. CBM-I training will target moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, a widespread problem area with considerable occupational and social impairment [8]. Participants will be visitors to Project Implicit Mental Health (PIMH), an existing website directed by the Principal Investigator that allows visitors to assess their cognitive biases tied to mental health concerns. Consistent with the RFA's priorities, this approach encourages efficiencies by capitalizing on the existing PIMH site and its heavy traffic. Further, the site's large number of visitors and use of automated assessments will make it efficient to assess baseline demographic characteristics and interpretation bias as moderators of CBM-I effects that can be tested in future trials.||Aim 1: Develop and evaluate usability and acceptability of web-based CBM-I for anxiety symptoms.||Aim 1 will build the web-based interpretation bias training program using the PIMH infrastructure. We will pilot the program on a small test group of moderate to highly anxious participants (N=15) who will complete questionnaires and semi-structured interviews to provide feedback on the programs' usability and acceptability. Further, an advisory board (N=8) of anxiety researchers, clinicians, and experts in CBM and web-based research will provide feedback on the program and study protocol. Using a ""deployment-focused"" approach, this feedback from experts and end-users will be used to iteratively modify the program for the trial planned for Aims 2 and 3. Thus, even at this initial pilot stage, we will measure the targeted outcome (anxiety symptoms) and mechanism (interpretation bias) to determine whether modifications to enhance target engagement are needed. Note, within Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), this outcome falls under the Potential Threat/Anxiety construct within the Negative Valence System, and the targeted mechanism (interpretation bias) falls under the Response Selection, Inhibition construct within the Cognitive (effortful) control system. Both the outcome and mechanism will be objectively measured using multiple units of analysis (e.g., behavior and self-report). Further, mechanisms underlying the guided anxious imagery prime's effects will be measured by assessing subjective distress, imagery vividness, and activation of feared outcomes following the manipulation. This prime was selected in part because of its potential to be disseminated widely in future trials, given it does not require human contact.||Aim 2: Test target engagement, feasibility and effectiveness of web-based CBM-I.||Aim 3: Evaluate the impact of an anxious prime on web-based CBM-I for anxiety symptoms.||Aims 2 and 3 will test the feasibility of an 8-session web-based interpretation training program among individuals with moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (based on screening at the PIMH site). Participants will be randomly assigned to positive CBM-I (90% positive scenario training), 50% positive/50% negative CBM-I, or a no scenario control condition. Half the participants in each of these 3 conditions will receive an anxious imagery prime prior to each training session, and half will receive a neutral imagery prime, resulting in a 3 training condition x 2 prime design (N=210; target of n=35 per condition). Feasibility will be determined by analyses of recruitment, attrition, acceptance of randomization, adherence to and appropriateness of the measurement model, caseness, extent of missing data, and safety. Additionally, target engagement (change in interpretation bias) and preliminary tests of effectiveness at reducing anxiety symptoms will be evaluated., Anxiety|Cognitive bias|Telemedicine",0

"Do Mind Ease Interventions Reduce Feelings of Acute Anxiety? A Randomised Controlled Trial, Anxiety is a common symptom in the world's population (Whiteford et al., 2013). It occurs as a symptom within other mental disorders and as a disorder in itself (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).||There are several ways of dealing with anxiety, from short guidance for coping on a symptom level to professional health. (Emmelkamp &amp; Ehring, 2014). Many people suffering from anxiety below a threshold indicating need for professional therapy may profit from strategies to calm down. (Helmchen &amp; Linden, 2000). Among the strategies that are effective, there are guided interventions that people can use via a web-based interface on a computer or smartphone (Taylor et al., 2021). While it is known for most interventions that they are helpful, it is often unclear if they work also in web-based environments (Baumel et al., 2020). This is because most research regarding the topic investigates the effectiveness of mental-health apps as a whole, while research of specific interventions is missing (Domhardt et al., 2019). However, to develop effective apps, it is crucial to identify which specific interventions are most efficient in a web-based setting. (Domhardt et al., 2019; Firth et al., 2017). Therefore we want to identify interventions working effectively in an online format.||Mind Ease is an app that offers different established interventions within one framework to their users when they feel anxious. This framework makes the different interventions comparable to each other. For this reason, we will test the interventions that are used in the Mind Ease-app.||In a first study we will correlate the Mind Ease 3-sliders-score with the state-trait- anxiety-Inventory (SAI). In a second study we will measure participants'; acute anxiety (with the 3-sliders- score) before and after they performed a 10 minutes web-based cognitive or mindfulness-associated intervention. We will compare the anticipated reduction in anxiety to the reduction measured in participants in a control group.||Prospectively registered here: https://osf.io/36ukh, anxiety|app|psychotherapy|mindfulness|acceptance and commitment therapy|cognitive behavioural therapy|randomised controlled trial|depression",0
"Modular Treatment for Preschool Anxiety, Early childhood mental illness is a growing public health concern, and can persist into adolescence and adulthood if left untreated. Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric illnesses in preschool aged youth and place youth at significantly higher risk for anxiety, depression, substance abuse, conduct problems, and diminished academic/occupational and social/relational functioning later in life. Accordingly, there is increasing emphasis on early identification and intervention, before symptoms become entrenched to mitigate a trajectory towards longstanding impairment.||Unfortunately, empirically supported treatments for preschoolers with anxiety are limited. The few studies to date have tended to focus on relatively homogeneous samples whose symptoms resemble those in adults (e.g., worries and fears). Anxiety can present in similar ways to adult anxiety, however can also present more broadly in young children. Young children with anxiety may also present with extreme rigidity, sensory hypersensitivity, 'meltdowns'/emotional dysregulation/temper tantrums, ritualistic/routine oriented behavior, and oppositional behavior in some context. By focusing narrowly, treatments have not been adapted for the full range of anxiety presentations in early childhood.||Therefore, the proposed study evaluates a modular, parent-driven psychotherapy developed for preschool aged youth (3-7 years) with diagnostic levels of anxiety, as well as anxiety symptoms dimensionally. The treatment program, Parent-training Intervention for Preschoolers with Anxiety (PIPA), is based on empirically supported behavioral and parent-training principles as well as the investigators' recently published pilot study of preschoolers with obsessive compulsive disorder. Sixty youth will be treated during the study. PIPA focuses on exposure and response prevention therapy (E/RP) in the context of behavioral parent training, each of which have efficacy in youth with anxiety, including high functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Certain parenting responses (e.g., overprotection, critical responding, accommodation of anxiety symptoms and avoidance) have been implicated in the etiology and maintenance of pediatric anxiety disorders and, in addition to E/RP, this intervention will target behavioral parent training and unhelpful parenting practices to support long-term outcomes.||In addition, this study will investigate one surrogate biomarker of anxiety in young children, fear conditioning (or more specifically, resistance to extinction). Behavioral treatment of anxiety, including the proposed PIPA intervention, relies on principles of extinction. Children and adults with anxiety disorders have been shown to have poorer fear extinction; however, there are few studies in young children examining this phenomenon. The potential to understand fear extinction in young children has implications for improving treatment efficacy and altering the negative trajectory of youth with anxiety disorders.||Eligibility will be determined at a baseline assessment. A second baseline assessment will occur one month later for those that qualify. This assessment will be used to control for symptom change due to the natural passage of time. Treatment will be delivered over 12 weeks and will include weekly 60-minute sessions. A brief phone call with an assessor each week will be used to track symptom change during treatment, and a post-treatment assessment will be conducted following the final treatment session, approximately 12 weeks later. Follow-up assessments will occur 1-month and 6-months following the final treatment session., modular|anxiety|preschool|exposure and response prevention|Cognitive behavioral therapy",0

"Attention Bias Modification Training in Youth With Subthreshold Impairing Anxiety, This study will collect preliminary data on Attention Bias Modification Training (ABMT) among clinic referred children and adolescents who display subthreshold impairing anxiety (SubImpAnx; anxiety & related impairment that fails to meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder). Traditional approaches to mental health service delivery cannot meet current demand. The inadequacies of traditional service delivery are magnified when viewed through the lens of impaired but undiagnosed youth. It is an unaddressed empirical question whether a least restrictive treatment can effectively reduce SubImpAnx in youth. Empirical efforts to address this issue are important because youths with SubImpAnx experience substantial impairment, are at high risk of escalation to full syndrome anxiety disorder, and pose a burden on the health care system.||This study will enroll 66 clinic referred children and adolescents (ages 8-16 years) who meet criteria for SubImpAnx. Participants will be randomly assigned to complete 8 sessions of either ABMT or a placebo control (PC) task over 4 weeks. Clinician ratings on youth anxiety severity and impairment will be evaluated as the primary outcome. Youth self ratings and parent ratings on youth anxiety symptoms and impairment will be evaluated as secondary outcomes. All measures will be collected before condition assignment (pretreatment), at immediate posttreatment, and at an 8 week follow up. In addition, initial data will be collected to shed light on whether it would be useful to pursue (a) attention bias to threat as a mediator of ABMT's anxiety reduction effects and (b) dose-response issues related to ABMT's anxiety reduction effects in a subsequent, larger study.||The specific aims are: Collect pilot data on the effects of ABMT and a PC task on levels of anxiety and impairment at a post evaluation (Aim 1) and at a follow up (FU) evaluation 8 weeks after the post evaluation (Aim 2); Preliminarily examine whether ABMT leads to lower levels of attention bias toward threatening stimuli as compared to a PC Task at post and 8 week FU (Aim 3); Describe the course of anxiety symptoms and impairment during treatment among youth in the ABMT condition (Aim 4).||This project will provide critically needed pilot data on ABMT for youth with SubImpAnx. With these data in hand, the field will be in a better position to determine whether ABMT may be used as a least restrictive intervention among anxious youth who are 'impaired but undiagnosed.', 0",0

"Interpretation Training to Reduce Anxiety: Evaluating Technology-based Delivery Models and Methods to Reduce Attrition, Approximately 25-30% of the U.S. population will experience anxiety pathology severe enough to qualify for an anxiety disorder diagnosis during their lifetime. Critically, the majority will not receive treatment, creating a serious need to consider alternative approaches to delivering mental health services that can meet needs on a larger scale. Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) interventions for anxiety hold considerable promise as a way to meet these needs. These programs alter biased ways of thinking, such as selective assignment of threat interpretations, which are known to cause and maintain anxiety. CBM for interpretation bias (CBM-I) has established efficacy when administered via computer in the laboratory, and there is clear evidence for target engagement (i.e., change in interpretations, the identified mechanism). Now, effectiveness needs to be tested in the community, using sufficiently large samples to evaluate key moderators of its effects, including delivery method (computer vs. mobile phone) and the addition of minimal human contact (for those at risk of attrition). Addressing attrition is critical given high rates of drop out for web-based interventions. Via the PI's MindTrails web site (established with the lab's prior NIMH R34MH106770 award), the lab already has the infrastructure to deliver CBM to the public and recruit large anxious samples. Moreover, the PI and Co-I have established infrastructure to do mobile sensing of mood and CBM-I delivery via mobile phones. Thus, the project can respond to NIMH's request for ""Effectiveness trials that can contribute to advancing the personalization of mental health care."" The current proposal aims to compare effectiveness and target engagement of CBM-I delivered via computer vs. mobile phone, and test if adding minimal human contact for participants at risk of dropout improves retention and outcomes. Study 1 will provide a pilot feasibility and user experience test of the CBM-I program on mobile phones. Study 2 will examine the lab's current online, computer-based CBM-I data to help determine empirical indicators of attrition. Study 3 will provide the primary test of moderators of effectiveness. Namely, in Study 3, high anxious participants will be randomized to one of 2 conditions: 1) CBM-I training delivered by computer or mobile phone (at existing MindTrails site); 2) Alternate intervention group-Psychoeducation only. CBM-I and Psychoeducation conditions include 5 weekly training sessions. Based on theoretically- and empirically-derived predictors of attrition, participants identified as high-risk for dropout in condition 1 will then be randomly assigned to add minimal human contact (using a modified TeleCoach protocol) or no change. Using this adaptive intervention, known as Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial (SMART), the project can test both the effects of CBM-I delivery method and the added value of human contact to improve retention for participants at high-risk for dropping out., Anxiety|Cognitive bias|Telemedicine",0

"Correlates of Anxiety Associated With a Life-threatening Illness, Diagnosis of, and living with a life-threatening illness can result in symptoms similar to those seen in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and these symptoms may persist even if the individual recovers, or their illness goes into remission. These symptoms may include emotional avoidance and numbing, difficulty relating to or connecting with friends or loved ones, difficulty sleeping, a sense of foreshortened future, and intrusive thoughts or memories related to the illness. These symptoms are an additional burden for the individual experiencing them and for their caretakers, and reduces quality of life.||Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy is an experimental treatment for anxiety disorders, and initial findings suggest that it holds promise for treatment of PTSD. This study will examine brain activity in participants enrolled in an investigation of the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in people with anxiety stemming from diagnosis with a life-threatening illness to see whether MDMA-assisted psychotherapy alters emotional reactivity to anxiety-provoking material, including positive and negative images. The study will also examine brain activity related to the experience of self-compassion/empathy in response to personalized audio scripts, and whether that response is altered by MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Brain imaging may offer a measure of neural markers of anxiety and self-compassion that do not rely on self-report.||A subset of participants in the study ""Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 2 Pilot Study of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for Anxiety Associated with a Life-Threatening Illness"" (NCT02427568) without any contraindicating factors for brain imaging will undergo three fMRI scans as part of this observational study. The first scan will occur prior to experimental sessions and a second scan will occur after two experimental sessions of MDMA or placebo-assisted psychotherapy. Participants will then be scanned a third time after they have completed a total of three sessions of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (this includes both subjects that are originally in the MDMA-assisted psychotherapy group, as well as the subjects in the placebo group who will cross over and complete three active MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions subsequent to their placebo-assisted psychotherapy. The primary endpoint will be the scan after the second session of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.||During each scanning session, participants will be undergoing brain scans with functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) while they perform an emotional regulation task that involves observing images possessing negative emotional valence. These images are drawn from, and have their emotional valence validated by, the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Participants are instructed either to view passively or attempt to reduce the negative affect associated with the images. In addition, resting state brain scans will also be acquired while subjects fixate on a central cross with no explicit task. Heart rate variability will be measured during these resting state scans. The comparison of changes in brain activity during execution of the emotional regulation task (as compared to baseline scans) after receiving psychotherapy with MDMA or placebo, as well as comparison of changes in resting state functional connectivity, are the primary outcome measures. Study observations are intended to assess changes in response to emotion-provoking material at several levels, most notably brain activity in response to anxiety producing images.||While in the scanner, subjects will also listen to prerecorded audio scripts about life stresses for themselves and for another person with instructions to practice compassion for themselves or for others.

"Effect of SPG Block for Patients With Anxiety at Electronic Dance Music Festivals, Background & Rationale||Electronic dance music festivals are a growing source of entertainment in Canada. Attended by thousands at a time, it is important to have a medical team onsite to manage clinical issues in these mass gatherings. One of the most common clinical presentations at these festivals is anxiety. In a low-resource setting, it is not always possible to supply all guests with oral or injectable anti-anxiety therapy. Additionally, anti-anxiety medication is often sedating, which we would want to avoid in a patient population at higher risk of sedation (e.g., intoxication). A simple, non-sedating, alternative treatment that can be administered by a medical team member that can be given without the need of a needle would be ideal.||Anecdotal reports have noted that sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) blocks with lidocaine, intranasally, is effective for the relief of anxiety. As well, the PI has had anecdotal success in managing patient anxiety with SPG blocks. At the time of writing, there has been no published study found by our team to evaluate the efficacy of SPG blocks on anxiety.||Research Question & Objectives||Question: In electronic dance music festival attendees, who present with anxiety to the medical team, how does a 2% lidocaine-soaked cotton tip applicator, inserted into both nares until it meets resistance, compare with a saline-soaked cotton tip applicator, inserted into both nares until it meets resistance, for self-reported anxiety 10-minutes post-intervention?||The objective of this trial is to study the effectiveness of bilateral SPG block for anxiety.||Methods||All individuals, who present with anxiety to the main medical area at electronic dance music festivals in Canada, will be recruited until sample size reaches at least 70 people. Inclusion criteria will include festival attendees aged 18+ with a complaint of anxiety. Exclusion criteria will include known allergy to lidocaine (standard practice involves medical team members asking patients what allergies they have), inability to pass a cotton tip applicator through the nares (e.g., obstruction), inability to report level of anxiety, or already have taken an anti-anxiety medication (e.g., lorazepam, midazolam).||After obtaining consent, participants will be randomized into two study arms using a random number generator. Arm 1 will receive an intranasal SPG block with 2% lidocaine in each nare, applied with long cotton tip applicators. Arm 2 will receive a long cotton tip applicator soaked with saline, inserted in each nare (placebo). The cotton tip applicators will remain in the nares for 10 minutes before removal.||After randomization, participants will be asked to rate their anxiety on a numeric response scale (0 to 10, where 0 is no anxiety and 10 is ""worst anxiety imaginable"") prior to receiving their assigned intervention. 10-minutes following intervention, participants will be asked to rate their anxiety once more., 0",0

The programme is standardized: Power Points presentations support each session and a detailed therapist manual and companion patient workbook accompany the programme.||For the ST group an evaluation will be administered pretest and post-test six months after the end of the schema therapy programme and at the same times for those in the control group. Socio-demographic and medical data, age, sex, level of education, marital status, number of children and professional status; date of diagnosis, disease type, level of disability (EDSS, Kurtzke, 1983) and information on relapses and treatments, are evaluated. The main criteria is the impact of schema therapy on anxiety evaluated by the BAI (beck anxiety inventory ) and level of cortisol at 6 month after the start program . Secondary criteria are: impact on the psychological dimensions assessed by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), intensity of fatigue assessed by Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), sleep quality evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index(PSQI) depression by BDI (beck depression inventory ) and quality of life evaluated by (Multiple sclerosis impact scale) MSIS29., anxiety|multiple sclerosis|schema therapy",0

"The Effect of Acupuncture on Pre-operative Anxiety Levels in Neurosurgical Patients: a Randomised, Controlled Trail, Methodology All patients presenting for neurosurgery will be considered and the study will take place on the Theatre Admissions Units at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom. After gaining consent, baseline anxiety levels will be assessed using the APAIS and STAI questionnaires. The subject will then be randomised using a web-based programme to one of two groups: intervention (Yintang point), or control (no intervention). All the acupuncture will done with the same type of needle and by the same investigator. The questionnaires will be repeated 30 minutes later to assess the effect of the intervention.|Design: type of study design and justification The study is a randomised control trial looking at an acupuncture point utilised for anxiety reduction (Yintang), and a controls. The ratio of intervention to controls is 1:1. After advice for experts in acupuncture, the investigators are not including a placebo acupuncture intervention or sham acupuncture. This is because it is increasingly recognised that any form of acupuncture or acupressure can have central effects and that sham acupuncture is actually impossible to undertake. Pilot study data (awaiting publication) done in the investigator's institution demonstrated a mean (standard deviation) STAI score in neurosurgical patients of 8.86 (4.4). Previous data have suggested that acupuncture may reduce anxiety levels by 25-37%. Assuming a p< 0.05 and power 0.9, in order to demonstrate a 30% reduction in STAI scores, the investigators will need 58 patients in each group. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, the investigators aim to recruit 64 patients in each group (128 in total). The investigators have shown that anxiety levels are not related to gender or site of surgery (cranial vs. spinal) and therefore will not stratify the groups. The investigators will undertake block randomisation to try and minimise any learning effects by the acupuncturist.|Analysis including statistical methods, where appropriate The investigators will use analysis of variance (ANOVA) to analyse anxiety scores from the two questionnaires (after testing for normality of data distribution).

"Neurofunctional Predictors of Escitalopram Treatment Response in Adolescents With Anxiety, The long-term goal of this study is to explore the neurobiological basis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using a validated functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm and functional connectivity analyses with a cohort of GAD patients and healthy subjects and generating feasibility and preliminary data regarding treatment-related effects of escitalopram on brain functional activation and Fc patterns in pediatric GAD. An additional goal is to identify biological markers in saliva and urine that will predict treatment response in pediatric subjects with GAD. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that core dysfunction within the prefrontal-amygdala network, which the investigators and others have observed in GAD, will be normalized by successful treatment. The rationale underlying this hypothesis is that, despite the high prevalence of GAD, there is a need to understand its neurobiology and to identify biomarkers of treatment response and the mechanisms by which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) putatively effect changes in the neurocircuitry of pediatric GAD., Anxiety|Adolescents with Anxiety",0

"EEG Alpha/Theta Neurofeedback to Reduce Trait Anxiety, Since the late 1960s neurofeedback treatment (NFT) has been used to treat adult individuals with anxiety disorders. Yet most related, evidence-based research studies were conducted between the mid-1970s and late 1990s. Therefore, NFT as an efficacious treatment for anxiety problems remains unclear. The literature research discloses that of few studies, most used sample sizes 10 subjects or less per experimental or control group and results have been mixed: Orne & Paskewitz (1974) and Watson & Herder (1980) found no significant effect sizes for anxiety symptom reduction and Egner, Strawson & Gruzelier (2002) did not find a significant difference in subjective activation level between alpha/theta (A/T) NFT and the sham group. On the other hand, Hardt & Kamiya (1978), Plotkin & Rice (1981), Sargunaraj, Kumaraiah, Mishra, & Kumar (1987), Rice, Blanchard & Purcell (1993), Vanathy, Sharma, & Kumar (1998), Sarkar, Rathee, & Neera (1999), Eismont Lutsyuk ,& Pavlenko (2011), and Gruzelier, Thompson, Redding, Brandt & Steffert (2013) did find a significant anxiety symptom reduction through NFT. The U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) at this time does not endorse NFT as an efficacious treatment for anxiety problems.||General hypothesis: A ten-session NFT protocol of up-training alpha (8-11 Hz) and theta (5-7.5 Hz) frequency bands lowers the subjective experience of trait anxiety and elevates mean theta and lowers alpha amplitudes in EEG recordings for individuals with moderate to high trait anxiety (while individuals' subjective experience of trait anxiety and theta/alpha ratios in the sham NFT condition will not change).||Control for treatment expectations and self-efficacy||There will be no significant differences between the treatment and the sham group in treatment expectations / self efficacy as measured by the Stanford Expectations of Treatment Scale (SETS) and the Rotter Locus of Control Scale.||There will be no significant differences between the treatment and the sham treatment group pre-and post treatment satisfaction as measured by assessments as measured by the SETS modified outcome scale.||Treatment effect hypotheses:||The treatment group will on average:||show higher mean theta and higher alpha amplitudes within and between sessions than the sham group.

The two reward sounds (low pan flute sound and steel drum sounds) will be playing as sustained MIDI sounds with amplitude modulation and will depend on the power of the respective wave frequencies. The reward criterion will be set at 250ms with a refractory period of 200 ms between rewards. Participants will also be shown a flying dragon looped video (Vulcan flying) which becomes brighter in color when alpha and/or theta power is up as a visual reward and see their reward percentage as a number on the screen beside the looped video. Both groups will be trained in three segments of eight minutes of NFT with an up to 90s break (depending on the participants' preferences) between each of the segments.||The experimental A/T NFT group will receive ten sessions of A/T NFT - specifically up-training alpha (8-11 Hz, low pan flute sound) and theta (5-7 Hz, steel drum sound). The sham NFT group will receive ten sessions of two alternating NFT protocols. In odd-numbered sessions (1,3,5,7,9) lobeta (13-16 Hz pan flute sound) and hibeta (16-22 Hz, steel drum sound) will be uptrained and alpha (8-11 Hz), theta (5-7.5 Hz) and hibeta (23-30 Hz) are inhibited. In even numbered sessions (2,4,6,8,10) beta (13-16 Hz, pan flute sound) and hibeta (16-22 Hz, steel drum) are down-trained and alpha (8-11 Hz), theta (5-7.5 Hz) and hibeta (23-30 Hz) are inhibited.||The BrainAvatar® 4.0 suite (Brainmaster Technologies, Inc; http://www.brainmaster.com), will be used for all NFT.

Filters used will be a band pass filter (80Hz high and 60 low pass) and an A/D low pass filter (allowing 0-30 Hz activity). Smoothing time will be 0.5s at 3 dB. The artifact rejection threshold will be set at 200 microV.||Statistical analysis:||The overall design of the proposed study calls for a mixed ANOVA Treatment condition (A/T vs. sham) serves as the between-subjects, and pre/post levels of anxiety, as the within-subjects factor. Treatment effectiveness (across both groups) would be reflected in a significant within-subjects effect and the efficacy of NFT specifically would be reflected in an interaction whereby significantly more improvement (i.e. lowered trait anxiety) would be found in the A/T in contrast to the Sham-Control condition.

"An Online Home-based Intervention for Anxiety Regulation, Anxiety disorders, defined by excess worry, hyperarousal and fear, are amongst the most common class of psychiatric conditions in adults. Large population-based studies on anxiety disorders estimated a lifetime prevalence of 33.7% and a 12-month prevalence between 2.4% and 29.8%. In Singapore, however, studies have only established the prevalence of a limited range or anxiety disorders. In a nationwide, cross-sectional, epidemiological survey, the lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders, specifically Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, rose from 0.9% and 3.0% respectively in 2010, to 1.6% and 3.6% in 2016. If untreated, anxiety disorders could result in a range of personal and societal costs, such as interpersonal dysfunctions, employment, physical health, social functioning, and frequent primary and acute care visits, resulting in a poor quality of life.||A large proportion of the population experiences subclinical symptoms of anxiety disorders which impede daily functioning and well-being, but most often do not seek professional help or fall below the radar of psychiatric services. Current treatment guidelines recommend pharmacotherapy (i.e. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] or venlafaxine) and psychotherapy (i.e. cognitive behavior therapy [CBT]) as first-line treatments for anxiety disorders. Unfortunately, SSRIs are associated with an increased risk of suicide in young adults. Thus, local practices often incorporate more psychological therapies in the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, CBT is labor-intensive and time-consuming - which is incompatible with the demanding lifestyle Singaporeans lead these days. Moreover, therapeutic outcomes are also very much therapist dependent. Due to the fear of stigma that is particularly salient in the local context, individuals with anxiety may be deterred from engaging with therapists. Even if these individuals do receive adequate treatment, existing literature shows that outcomes for recommended treatment modalities are sub-optimal at best, i.e. overall mean remission rate of CBT is 51% while pharmacotherapy is significantly lower. With the low rates of help-seeking behaviors and dismal success rates of existing therapies, novel interventions for anxiety are apposite and vital.||The benefits of mindfulness-based interventions have been extensively researched in anxiety disorders in recent years. Improvements reported across a range of outcomes include enhanced ability to cope with stress, reduced depressive and anxiety symptom severity, as well as improved sleep quality, all of which lead to increased life satisfaction and overall well-being. Not all anxiety regulation strategies are helpful, and mindful emotion regulation presents one promising strategy by cultivating a changing of relationship with one's emotions. Specifically, this strategy facilitates reduced reactivity to emotional stimuli by encouraging one to meet, accept, and detach from one's aversive feelings, thoughts, and ineffective habitual responses. Unfortunately, clinically anxious individuals with no experience in such practices could find it challenging to engage in them as they often require a high degree of individual discipline. Coupled with the fact that sustained practice is crucial to yield the benefits of mindfulness practice, an appealing mode of treatment delivery is necessary. To this end, gamification strategies could be useful: gamification strategies have been shown useful in motivating health-related behaviors through interaction with the immersive interventional programs. Recent preliminary studies have also suggested that neuro-/ biofeedback-based relaxation and mindfulness training is useful for both healthy and anxious individuals.||Accordingly, we have developed an online, home-based, personalized, neuro-technological mindfulness-based intervention and seek to conduct a preliminary study with healthy young adults to evaluate its safety and acceptability. Our technology will deliver a mindfulness-based anxiety regulation intervention through a neuro-/ bio-feedback-based game interface that is driven by an electroencephalography (EEG) algorithm. We hypothesize that the intervention would be safe and acceptable. We further hypothesize that the intervention would help entrain anxiety regulation and ameliorate anxiety in healthy adults., Anxiety|Biofeedback|Intervention",0
"Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD)-Assisted Psychotherapy in People With Illness-related Anxiety, Diagnosis with a potentially fatal illness is distressing and can provoke anxiety that further reduces quality of life, and a treatment that reduces anxiety when facing deteriorating health and mortality will improve quality of life for people with such illnesses. Forty to fifty years ago, researchers investigated lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in combination with psychotherapy to treat anxiety when facing advanced stage cancer. This psychedelic (hallucinogenic) drug can produce transformative or mystical experiences and insights that can help in anxiety reduction. This study will be a randomized, active placebo controlled,double-blind pilot study of the safety and efficacy of LSD-assisted psychotherapy as a way of reducing anxiety in people with potentially fatal illnesses. This study will examine whether two sessions of LSD-assisted psychotherapy scheduled two to four weeks apart will reduce anxiety and improve quality of life for people experiencing anxiety as a result of a potentially fatal illness.||Study subjects will receive either 200 or 20 mcg (micrograms) LSD during two day-long psychotherapy sessions scheduled two to four weeks apart. Subjects in this study will have a 66% of receiving the full dose of 200 mcg LSD, and they have a 33% chance of getting the active placebo dose of 20 mcg LSD. Neither the researchers nor the subject will know whether he got 200 or 20 mcg LSD. Upon participant agreement, all psychotherapy sessions will be recorded to audio and video.||The randomized part of the study will last three and a half months (14 weeks).||People who learn they got the active placebo dose of LSD during the randomized phase can go on to to take part in an ""open label"" study phase, where they will get the full dose of LSD during two day-long psychotherapy sessions scheduled two to four weeks apart. ""Open label"" means that they and the researchers will both be aware that they are getting the full dose of LSD.||Participants who received the full dose of LSD and took part in all study visits will be assessed for symptoms of anxiety and depression and quality of life 12 months after their final experimental session., Anxiety|quality of life|psychotherapy|potentially fatal illness|lysergic acid diethylamide",0

"MindLight: A Video Game Intervention to Reduce Children's Anxiety, Over the next two years, the investigators will be collecting data on two samples, henceforth identified as the Clinical Sample and Prevention Sample. The laboratory protocol (pre, post, and follow-up) is the same for each; however the screening and recruitment are not. In this section, only those procedures and methods of the lab visit that are common to both are described. Next the video game intervention procedures are described. Participant and recruitment details are in subsequent sections.||Each participant will visit the Adolescent Dynamics Lab three times (pre, post, and follow-up) with only minor differences where noted. Parents will accompany children to the lab and, following the completion of consent forms (pre only), complete a set of questionnaires via computer:||Child report:||Demographics|Spence Child Anxiety Scale (SCAS)|Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)- emotional symptoms|Top Problems questionnaire (TP)|Coping Questionnaire|Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SEQ-C)||Parent report:||Demographics (including what interventions for child's mental health have been tried)|SCAS (report on child)|Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - emotional symptoms (report on child)|Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS21, report on self)||Questionnaires at Post are the same as Pre and Follow-up except for addition of Video game evaluation (child report).||Once questionnaires are completed, the child participant will have sensors for psychophysiological recording attached by a female experimenter. First, two sensors for recording electrodermal response (aka galvanic skin response or skin conductance) will be attached to the tips of the second and third finger of the non-dominant hand. Children's fingers will be wiped clean before applying a dab of conducting gel on the two fingers and affixing the sensors with Velcro straps firmly but not uncomfortably. Next, two sticker electrodes for measuring electrocardiogram signals (e.g., heart rate) are applied in a Lead-II configuration: one affixed just below the right collarbone and the other on the side of the torso near the lower left rib. These circular stickers (about the size of a Loonie) have a metal nub to which wires are affixed via clips. Finally, a respiration belt is wrapped around the torso below the breast or pectoral muscle outside of the clothing. The belt is elastic and registers the expansion and contraction due to respiration. All three measurement devices are attached to a Biopac TEL-100 battery pack attached to the back of the participant's chair. This device is then attached to a computer in the adjacent room via the Biopac MP-150 amplifier. Physiological signals are recorded using AcqKnowledge 4.2 software from Biopac. The child and parent will be able to observe the signals as they will be recorded via a monitor in the observation room.||Once the sensors and physiological recording has been set up, the parent will be asked to leave the room and wait in a room nearby until the child has completed the tasks. The sequence of tasks is:||Baseline Physiology (3 tasks): (a) equipment baseline: watch a neutral film to allow the measurements to settle(2 minutes), (b) paced breathing to get resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; a measure of parasympathetic activity) while participants breathe in and out in synch with a bar that goes up and down at 9 cycles per minute displayed on a monitor (2 minutes), and (c) pre-task baseline for calculating reactivity to social and cognitive stress (2 minutes)|Attention bias task: dot probe task. (5 minutes)|Social Stress Task: spontaneous speech on any topic of the child's choosing (3 minutes).|Quick self-report of feelings (< 1 minute)|Recovery 1: participant sits alone in the observation room quietly to assess return to baseline levels of arousal (3 minutes).|Cognitive Stress Task: counting backwards by 7's from 2148. Incorrect answers will require the participant to start over from the beginning (2 minutes)|Recovery 2: participant sits alone in the observation room quietly to assess return to baseline levels of arousal (3 minutes).||Finally, the parent will be brought back into the room as the sensors are removed. Debriefing will occur only after the final follow-up lab visit. Anticipated time to complete lab visit is approximately one hour.||MINDLIGHT GAME PLAY Participants in the treatment condition will play 5 total hours of MindLight, one hour at each sitting, over the course of 2-3 weeks. Game play will occur either in schools or at the participant's home. For the Prevention Sample, MindLight will be played in participating middle and high schools in the Limestone District School Board. Participants in the Clinical Sample who attend these schools will also play the game at the school. However, for children recruited through the Hotel Dieu Mood and Anxiety clinic (see recruitment details) who do not attend one of the participating schools will play MindLight at home. In all cases, a research assistant will be present to set up the game and monitor any equipment difficulties.||To play the game, children will wear a lightweight MindWave headset that has a single electrode that must touch the forehead (see attached images). There is a clip that attaches comfortably to the earlobe as well. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in the alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies are used to extract two continuous signal streams that are measures of focused attention and arousal. These signals are used in the game to control the character's ""mind light,"" a magical hat he wears that has a light on the end of a signal antenna, by focusing a beam of light toward specific targets to solve puzzles within the game and expanding the range of light inversely proportional to the degree of arousal. Thus, children control key aspects of the game with their mind.||Control participants in the Prevention Sample will play Max and the Magic Marker, a commercially available game with similar features to MindLight but without the key mechanisms targeting anxiety reduction (attention bias modification and relaxation). The amount of game play time and location will be the same as those in the intervention group.||ONLINE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY Control participants in the Clinical Sample will receive an online version of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) based on the skills taught in Mind over Mood by D. Greenberger and C. Padesky. The program provides general information on each topic, an overview on helpful skills, and homework sheets by email that directly corresponds with how a live, 8-week group therapy session would be conducted. Participants will also receive feedback on homework on a specific day every week from a therapist at Hotel Dieu.||Description of participants CLINICAL SAMPLE Children 8-16 years old who have made an appointment at the Mood and Anxiety Clinic at Hotel Dieu specifically for problems with anxiety. Only those with autism or significant developmental delays will be excluded. The investigators will recruit 100 children, with half randomly assigned to the MindLight intervention group.||PREVENTION SAMPLE Children 10-16 years old attending participating schools in the Limestone District School Board who have been identified as having elevated anxiety symptoms via a self-report measure of anxiety. Only those with autism or significant developmental delays will be excluded. The investigators will recruit 100 children, with half randomly assigned to the MindLight intervention group.||Recruitment details CLINICAL SAMPLE Participants will be recruited following initial assessment at the Hotel Dieu Mood and Anxiety Clinic. The typical wait period between this initial diagnostic assessment and the start of either group or one-on-one therapy is 3-6 months. Our intervention will occur during this wait period. During the initial assessment at the clinic, children aged 8-16 will be invited to participate in the study. They will be provided a brief explanation of the study and will indicate to the clinician whether they give permission to be contacted by the recruitment coordinator who will provide all of the details of the study. The participant will be made aware that they are under no obligation to participate in the study by agreeing to be contacted. Those who assent to participate will be invited to the Adolescent Dynamics Lab to begin participation.||PREVENTION SAMPLE Children in grades 6-10 who attend one of the participating schools will complete one questionnaire during class time, the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS). Children who score 1 standard deviation above the mean for (a) the total score or (b) two of the subscales (not including the obsessive-compulsive scale) will be considered at risk for developing an anxiety disorder.

"Emotion-Focused Mindfulness Therapy: A Feasibility Study for Late Life Anxiety, The purpose of this small scale RCT is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of EFMT among community dwelling older adults who experience anxiety. This study has the following three aims: to determine if participants can be recruited, enrolled, and retained; to determine if participants can adhere to all components of the intervention; and to determine the extent to which participants who receive the intervention have decreased levels of anxiety compared to those who do not receive the intervention. The secondary outcomes will be to determine the extent to which participants who receive the intervention have improved sleep quality, and improved subjective memory functioning compared to those who do not receive the intervention.||This will be a small pilot RCT study that will use a wait list control trial design. Participants will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group. Emotion-Focused Mindfulness Therapy (EFMT) is a group intervention consisting of eight weekly meetings of 2.5 hours with 10 - 12 participants per group. Participants are provided instruction that encourages noting and experiencing bodily sensations and emotions during meditations. Meditations are conducted in silence for between twenty and thirty-five minutes, and then participants are asked to journal their recollection of the meditation and experiences that arise for them as they journal. Following journalling, each participant describes their experience in meditation, with the facilitator offering empathic exploration to support transforming negative emotions into adaptive emotions.||The study will be conducted in an online delivery PHIPPA protected platform and has been modified to accommodate electronic delivery. Maximum number of participants per group will be six, and each session will be 1.5 hours. Data will be collected at three points by a research assistant to evaluate the feasibility of EFMT for older adults and determine whether anxiety is influenced by the intervention., anxiety|aging and health|adults aged 65 and older|mindfulness based intervention|meditation",0

"Effect Of Musıc Therapy On Anxıety Levels In COVID-19 Pandemıc, Today, billions of people are struggling with the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus. The pandemic causes many psychosocial and mental health problems in humans. (Montano and Acebes 2020, Guo, Feng et al. 2020, Ostacoli, Cosmo et al. 2020, Carmassi, Foghi et al. 2020, Heitzman 2020, Sun, Sun et al. 2021, Yuan ,Gong et al. 2021, Taylor, Landry et al 2020 ). Many people have faced problems such as stress, depression and anxiety (Liu, Yang et al 2020). Compared to other segments of the society, health workers experience these problems more frequently and more severely. The reason for this is that healthcare professionals undertake the task of providing health care services to people infected with the virus, being together with patients, having close contact and meeting their health needs. This situation triggers the risk of contact with patients, fear of death, concerns about the health of themselves and their family members, and psychological problems (Aykurt and Aykurt 2020). Therefore, healthcare workers are considered to be a high-risk group in which the psychological consequences of COVID-19 are significant and persistent (Fiorillo and Gorwood 2020).||Studies in the literature have shown that healthcare workers experience severe anxiety due to COVID-19. (Yanez, Jahanshahi et al 2020, Sahebi, Nejati et al 2021, Lai, Ma et al 2019, Ataç, Sezerol et al 2020, Luo, Liu et al 2021).||It is very important to screen health workers who provide uninterrupted service in pandemic conditions in terms of anxiety and other psychological problems and to plan remedial interventions. In this context, music therapy, which is known as an effective method to reduce the anxiety level of individuals and reduce stress, comes to mind. Music therapy studies with healthcare professionals are limited in the literature. In this context, it is aimed that this study will contribute to filling this gap in the literature and creating a database., Music Therapy",0

All these activities were given at the patients' bedside, with or without parental supervision, either once or spreading over an hour, depending on the ward routine.||Data Collection Methods||Approval for the study was obtained from the hospital ethics committees. A research assistant collected demographic data from the parents and from the children's medical records after obtaining the consent form. The children's baseline anxiety levels were also documented. For the experimental group, the interventions started after the baseline data had been collected. The emotional behaviour of each child was observed by a research assistant for two consecutive days, at the end of which a research assistant documented the child's overall emotional behaviour, using the CEMS. The child's anxiety levels were reassessed and documented.||Analysis||The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software, version 20.0 for Windows was used for the data analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate the means, standard deviations, and ranges of the scores on the various scales. The homogeneity of the two groups was examined using inferential statistics (independent t-test and chi-squared). The interrelationships among the scores on the different scales and the demographic variables were assessed using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Differences in the mean scores on the CEMS and the children's anxiety levels between the two intervention groups were investigated by an independent t-test and mixed between-within subjects ANOVA, respectively. Multiple regression analysis was performed to examine the effects of participants' demographic and clinical characteristics on the outcome measures., 0",0
"Effect of Music on Patients' Anxiety During Lower Limb Arthroplasty Procedures Under Spinal Anaesthesia, Music is becoming an increasingly popular adjunct to traditional medical therapies. International studies have shown the numerous benefits of music in a medical setting. Music has been used effectively to decrease patients' anxiety under neuraxial anaesthesia for caesarean section. There is currently a lack of evidence supporting the use of music to reduce patients' anxiety under neuraxial anaesthesia for lower limb arthroplasty procedures. The worldwide growth of the ageing population has led to an increased demand for arthroplasty. It is imperative that the anaesthetic technique used for this procedure is both safe and is associated with high levels of patient satisfaction. The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of music, to a control, on peri-operative anxiety in patients undergoing lower limb arthroplasty procedures under spinal anaesthesia., Music|Perioperative anxiety|Spinal anaesthesia|Lower limb arthroplasty",0
"Is Auriculotherapy Responsible for Improvements on Anxiety Students' Prior and After Examinations?, To treat anxiety, conventional medicine relies on medicines such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, barbiturates, and antihistamines. However, several authors have reported western medicine cannot resolve all anxiety diseases and the risk of side effects, resistance to pharmacological treatments affects approximately one in three patients with anxiety disorders.||Alternatively, auriculotherapy is a technique similar to reflexology. It is speculated the technique might work in anxiety because groups of pluripotent cells contain information from the whole organism creating regional organization centres representing different parts of the body, through the recruitment of more cortex cells dedicated to specific body areas. Thus reflex points in the ear can incite body responses by the stimulation of reticular formation and the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The information that comes from the thermal, Algic and proprioceptive stimuli are transmitted from the auricular pavilion by the fibres of the nerves: trigeminal; Auricular magnum and minor occipital (sensitive branch of the cervical plexus) and the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is responsible for the parasympathetic innervation of the lung, heart, stomach, and small intestine, as well as the pharynx and larynx muscles and it also sends information to important brain regions (e.g., locus coeruleus, orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus and at amygdala) in the regulation of anxiety. In turn, the trigeminal nerve controls, mainly, the mastication muscles and the facial sensitivity while the cervical plexus nerve is responsible for neck muscles, diaphragm, and thorax., Anxiety|Vagus nerve stimulation|auriculotherapy|students",0
"Anxiety Self-Management for ICU Patients Receiving Mechanical Ventilation, A three group randomized trial with repeated measures. Participants are assigned by chance to one of three groups: 1) patient-directed, as desired music listening through headphones, 2) noise-canceling headphones only, or 3) usual care. Participants remain in the study, up to 30 days, as long as they are receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU, choose to withdraw, or become unable to complete the daily anxiety assessments. Information is collected daily on patient-perceived anxiety levels (visual analog scale & State Anxiety Inventory), ventilator settings, and all medications received. Urine is collected each day the participant is on the ventilator to determine level of stress (cortisol) if the kidneys are functioning appropriately and the participant is not receiving medications known to influence cortisol levels.||Mechanical ventilation is a common treatment for respiratory problems for patients in the ICU. Patients receiving mechanical ventilation experience much anxiety and distress from the placement of the endotracheal tube (breathing tube) and the mechanical ventilator itself. The usual treatment for these symptoms are medications, which are very potent and have numerous adverse side effects, removing patient involvement and control from managing these symptoms. Music has been shown to decrease anxiety and promote relaxation in limited, single listening intervention studies with patients in the ICU on ventilators. This study tests whether having patients listen to preferred music (familiar & comforting) whenever feeling anxious and wanting to relax for as long as they would like to listen to music through headphones throughout the entire time they are on the ventilator can improve outcomes such as less anxiety, shorter time on the ventilator, receipt of fewer medications, and less stress when compared to patients who do not listen to music while they are on the ventilator. Results from this study will advance nursing science by providing evidence on the efficacy of a simple, self-directed intervention that the millions of patients who receive mechanical ventilation each year in the ICU can use themselves to treat the very common symptoms of anxiety and distress. Results from this study will expand the knowledge base of adjunctive interventions that can be implemented in the ICU to involve patients directly in managing their own symptoms, ultimately improving patient outcomes.||Patients who are alert and can provide consent are invited to participate if they are on the ventilator in one of the participating ICUs. Patients remain in the study for as long as they are on the ventilator (up to 30 days) and can provide daily assessment of their anxiety levels. Patients are free to withdraw, however, at any time. Patients randomized to music receive an assessment of their music preferences by a professional music therapist. The music therapist then develops a music collection for each participant, based in individual preferences, that is kept at the bedside throughout the duration of being on the ventilator. The music therapist also visits with music participants' daily to determine if preferences have changed and if he/she desires additional music compact disks (CDs) to be kept at the bedside. Data is collected from the medical record on all medications and ventilator settings each day the participant is enrolled in the study. All urine is collected each day the participant remains in the study if the kidneys are functioning properly and the participant is not receiving medications known to influence cortisol, a marker for an integrative level of stress., Ventilator|chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|Anxiety",0

"Does Virtual Parental Presence Reduce Preoperative Anxiety in Children, The investigators' goal in this study is to investigate the effects of virtual parental presence and coaching of parents on anxiety in children at induction of anesthesia. The primary hypothesis is virtual parental presence during induction of anesthesia is superior to physical parental presence during induction of anesthesia in reducing anxiety in children at induction of anesthesia. The secondary hypothesis is that the coaching of parents modulates the effect of physical or video parental presence at induction anesthesia on children's anxiety., 0",0
"Effects of Psilocybin in Advanced-Stage Cancer Patients With Anxiety, The significance of this study is that it is addressing the important issues of psychological and spiritual well being of people who have advanced cancer. In 2001, the National Cancer Policy Board of the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council issued a report (Improving Palliative Care for Cancer: Summary and Recommendations) that specifically recommended research be conducted using novel agents and methods. Psilocybin is a novel agent which produces a profound alteration in your state of consciousness. It is the main active ingredient found in ""magic mushrooms"".||Our specific aim is to learn whether this psychoactive drug, psilocybin, might be effective in reducing anxiety, depression and physical pain, and therefore improving your quality of life. This pilot study will start with 12 people ages 18-70. For each participant there will be two overnight admissions to the hospital. In one session you will be given a placebo and in the other you will get the active medication, but no one will know which drug is administered when. This is called a double blind study. You will be asked to fill out questionnaires about how you feel, your pain levels and your moods. There will also be at least two psychotherapy meetings before the study sessions, so that you are fully aware of what to expect and to have all your questions answered.||We cannot take you in the study if you have central nervous system (CNS) cancers, kidney disease, diabetes, abnormal liver function tests, epilepsy, cardiovascular disease including untreated high blood pressure (BP greater than 140/90), and pregnancy. The psychiatric exclusions are: you or an immediate family member with a history of a major psychiatric disorder, a current substance abuse problem, or an anxiety or a mood disorder within 1 year prior to the onset of symptoms of your current illness.||We also cannot take you in the study if you are taking certain medications, such as: anti-seizure, insulin and oral hypoglycemics, and cardiovascular drugs (except anti-hypertensive medications). Some antidepressant (SSRIs) medications cannot be taken within the two weeks prior to the session (except for Prozac, which cannot be taken in the last 5 weeks prior to the session).||You will get a MRI of the brain prior to admission (if you haven't had one in the prior two months), at the study's expense, to be sure there is no CNS involvement. You can provide us, or the study will pay for, lab work from the prior 2 weeks (CBC, liver function and renal function). The history and physical, neurological exam, EKG, and a urine pregnancy test (if you are a woman with child-bearing potential), will be done on admission by the house staff doctors.||You will be allowed to take your own medications while in the hospital, and will be encouraged to bring to the hospital personal photos, small memorabilia, and some of your favorite music that can be played during the sessions., Anxiety|Depression|Mood|Cancer|Quality of Life|Psychiatric|Psilocybin|Alternative|Los Angeles",0
"The Effects of Music & Auditory Beat Stimulation on Anxiety, In this study, the investigators examined and compared the effectiveness of ABS in the theta range, calm music playlist curated by an affective music recommendation system, and the combination of ABS and the same music to reduce anxiety and stress levels (as measured by the State Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA)) compared to a control condition (pink noise). Prior work has demonstrated that ABS and music both reduce anxiety when presented on their own. It is hypothesized that music with ABS will lead to significantly lower anxiety levels and increased calmness compared to the other experimental conditions. Approximately 163 participants were recruited from the Prolific online participant pool (https://www.prolific.co). The experiment was conducted on the Qualtrics survey platform, and the experimental treatment was provided with the LUCID Research App. After reading and agreeing with the consent form, participants provided their Prolific ID and then filled out the Short Test of Music Preferences (STOMP), Queen's Music Questionnaire, Anxiety coping method's questionnaire, Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and the State Trait Inventory of Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA). Participants were also asked to list any medications currently being taken (including cannabis). Participants were then randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: (1) music; (2) music and auditory beat stimulation (ABS); (3) auditory beat stimulation (ABS) alone; or (4) pink noise for 24 minutes. Participants then received instructions on how to download the LUCID Research app on their iOS device or access the LUCID Research App through a virtual machine using their computer. Participants listened to their randomly assigned treatment for 24 minutes. Participants then completed their post-intervention questionnaires which included: the STICSA state version, SAM and PANAS. The investigators' hypotheses were that the combined, music alone and ABS alone conditions would experience a greater reduction in somatic and cognitive state anxiety compared to the pink noise control condition. These hypotheses were pre-registered using the Open Science Framework (Registration DOI: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/VHCA5) and were based upon previous studies showing that ABS and music listening are capable of reducing anxiety. The investigators had no specific predictions for moderate and high trait anxiety participants, but their pre-registration noted their intention to recruit from both of these populations., Anxiety|Auditory Beat Stimulation|Binaural Beats|Mental Health|Music|Neuroscience|Psychology",0
"Using Smartphones to Enhance the Treatment of Childhood Anxiety, Boys and girls between the ages of 9-14 who have anxiety and a parent or caregiver are being asked to participate in this study. Interested participants who contact the study will be asked to undergo a brief phone pre-screen to determine initial eligibility.||After completing a phone pre-screen, potential participants for the Phase 2 trial will be invited to the lab to complete a clinical intake interview. Clinical information will be obtained from parent and child by a trained research staff member. The research staff member will have specific training to a high degree of reliability in conducting the diagnostic interviews relevant to this research study.||Participants that meet study criteria based on the clinical information obtained at the first study visit will be invited to begin a course of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), an empirically validated talk therapy commonly used to treat children with anxiety. Children will receive individual treatment using the Brief Coping Cat Manual. The Coping Cat program (Kendall 1994) is an empirically supported child-focused CBT treatment for children with anxiety disorders. Throughout the program, children are encouraged to practice techniques learned during therapy sessions through homework or ""Show-That-I-Can"" (STIC) tasks. Parents attend weekly check-ins and two parent-only sessions. STIC tasks will consist of specific SmartCAT modules in the smartphone app as assigned at the end of each session. Participants might be asked to interact with other children and adolescents or study staff as well as leave the therapy building. This is to allow participants to become more comfortable in situations that make them feel anxious by gradually exposing them to the specific situation. Parents are not treated as co-clients, but are considered consultants to the child's treatment and are asked to provide some collaboration and assistance in exposure planning and homework.||Treatment will be delivered by Masters-level therapists who will have completed training in CBT. They will attend a weekly supervision session with Dr. Silk, with consultation from Dr. Kendall on difficult cases via videoconference. All sessions will be videotaped.||SMARTPHONE PROTOCOL:||Prior to the first therapy session, the child and a parent will be trained how to use the SmartCAT app. Youth will be provided with an Android smartphone for the duration of the study. If the child already has an Android phone, the app will be installed on the participant's phone in order to decrease participant burden of carrying an additional phone.||Participants will be given a study-provided, pre-programmed smartphone on which they will enter their responses to a series of questions about moods and daily experiences using an app developed for this study. The child will receive an electronic notification message once per day and will be prompted through a series of questions about what he/she is doing, who he/she is with, how he/she is feeling, worries or stressful events, and how he/she coped with these events. It should take the child approximately 5 minutes each time to complete the questions. The child will only be prompted to answer these questions outside of school hours and on weekends. Participant data will be securely sent to study therapists via a clinician portal connected to the app to be reviewed weekly. The therapists may then integrate this information into treatment and provide customized feedback to the patient.||Parents will be asked to complete an online diary to keep track of what skills their child uses during the week. After completion of the initial screening visit, parents are asked to complete the Skills Use Diary daily for seven days. After this seven day period, they will be asked to complete a diary entry twice per week throughout 8 weeks of treatment, totaling 30 entries. At the end of treatment, subjects will again be asked to complete the diary daily for another seven days. Participants will receive links to the online diary and instructions for completion via email (see references and other attachments for the email script). Diaries should take no longer than 10 min per day to complete. The data will be encrypted and stored securely through the online survey system Qualtrics.||POST-TREATMENT and 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP:||All clinical, skill acquisition, and skill utilization measures (including the parent 7 day diary) will be repeated at post-treatment (approximately 10 weeks) and 2 month follow-up We will use Qualtrics, a secure internet data collection system, for administering diaries and questionnaires., child anxiety|worries|fears|talk therapy",0
"Therapeutic Communication Training of the Stretcher Bearers on the Patient Anxiety (STRESSCOM), Anxiety is a form of psychic and/or physical discomfort caused by the feeling of the imminence of a danger. It is a normal reaction of adaptation and defense face to a situation lived as hostile. It is a frequent perioperative manifestation. Patients who need an intervention are indeed 20% more anxious than the general population. The occurrence of this anxiety can have consequences for perioperative medical care influencing morbidity and mortality.||Pharmacological premedication initially prescribed in the 19th century to limit the adverse effects of general anesthesia is currently used to fight perioperative anxiety. However, its effects are now considered as controversial.||and non-drug techniques have been studied. They have the advantage of being inexpensive and causing little or no adverse effects.||Therapeutic communication can be defined as a relational technique that seeks to separate the patient from the surrounding reality to provide analgesia or anxiolysis through the suggestion of positive images with a chosen verbal and nonverbal approach.||The knowledge of communication techniques resulting from hypnosis by the healthcare team could therefore optimize patient medical care in terms of analgesia and the management of perioperative anxiety. Therapeutic communication training in the operating room is short and accessible to all members of the team regardless of their rank. This is a training provided internally by a certified practitioner in therapeutic hypnosis, aiming to give to the professionals knowledge to optimize the patient support. At the hospital (Groupement des Hôpitaux de l'Institut Catholique de Lille), several stretcher bearers have been trained in therapeutic communication and are already applying it routinely.||No study has yet investigated the impact of the use of therapeutic communication in the operating room to control the level of anxiety of patients.||This study is prospective, monocentric, comparative, double blind. Two groups of patients will be compared: In the first group patients will be accompanied to the operating room by a stretcher-bearer trained in therapeutic communication, in the second group patients will be accompanied by a stretcher bearer without this specific training., Therapeutic communication|Anxiety|Endoscopic examination under general anesthesia|Operating room|Stretcher bearer",0

"Magic Therapy to Relieve Pediatric Patient Anxiety and Improve the Hospitalization Experience, The use of magic in healthcare has been described across a variety of settings. Several peer-reviewed publications have described the use of magic to help encourage the recovery of motor skills 2. Green et al. reported that after the completion of an intense 2-week magic-theme summer camp, patients with spastic hemiplegia significantly increased the usage of their affected hand 3. Another investigation sought to study if magic could be used to aid in communication with mentally-disabled children 4. This study concluded that magic was effective in building trust, improving the subjects' self-esteem, and enriching their interpersonal skills.||Magic has also been partially studied in a surgical context for relieving perioperative anxiety. One study sought to evaluate the efficacy of clowns (whose performance included magic tricks) in relieving perioperative anxiety 5. Patients that were undergoing surgical procedures were placed in either a clown group or non-clown group. These patients were not grouped based on surgical procedures, and patients were included that were undergoing one of ten different surgeries. Anxiety levels of the pediatric patients were measured in the waiting room and induction room immediately prior to anesthesia administration. Additionally, parent state and trait anxiety was measured during their child's induction using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Health professionals involved in the surgeries were also questioned using a questionnaire developed by the authors to obtain health providers' opinion regarding the presence of clowns as administered in the study. Moreover, clowns filled out a self-evaluation form regarding how they believed their interaction with the child went prior to the surgery. The authors found that the clown group displayed decreased anxiety during anesthesia induction but not in the waiting room. They also documented that health professionals believed the clowns benefitted the child, but at the same time, a majority of the staff discouraged continuance of the program due to interference with operating room procedures.||This study will assess the efficacy of magic therapy services in relieving pediatric patient anxiety and parent anxiety in an inpatient setting. It will also measure family satisfaction with child life services during the hospital visit and health professional opinions regarding such a therapy in an inpatient setting. The primary evaluation method will be through surveys. No prior investigations have studied using magic therapy as a primary tool to improve the psychological well-being of pediatric patients over the span of an inpatient hospitalization. Study and improvement of magic therapy services provides an evidence-based approach to improve pediatric patient psychological well-being, assist physicians in obtaining pediatric patient cooperation with procedures, and improving the hospitalization experience for the family of hospitalized pediatric patients., Magic|Anxiety|Pediatric",0

"EFFECTS OF REPEATED GENERAL ANAESTHESIA ON THE LEVEL OF PRE-PROCEDURE ANXIETY IN CHILDREN UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY., Radiotherapy procedures are used to damage or destroy growing cancer cells.(1) This strategic use of ionized radiation is being practiced since the early 20th century and is very effective in destroying diseased cancer cells while sparing the healthy ones.(2) These procedures require patients to stay absolutely still, hence requiring general anesthesia in case of children compared to the adults. The treatment also requires multiple cycles of radiotherapy for which children have to undergo general anaesthesia multiple times.(3) Multiple anaesthetics for the same child may lead to preoperative anxiety, increased autonomic fluctuations, increased demand for anaesthetics and nausea/vomiting.(4-5) Pre-operative anxiety not only causes physical but also emotional and psychological trauma.(6) Such patients, subjected to anxiety, may face fear and potential hesitance in visiting the pre-anesthesia clinics for evaluation, induction and problems in pre-operative and recovery span.(7-8)It is therefore important to gauge the extent of this anxiety and to see whether it increases or decreases with subsequent cycles of treatment .Unless this is identified it will be difficult to put appropriate treatments in place.||Though previous studies are available on pre-operative anxiety in children but there has been little research about level of a child's anxiety under going repeated general anesthesia, especially during radiotherapy sessions.

"Medical Hypnosis Against Anxiety and Pain in Electro-neuro-myography, Medical hypnosis is more and more used during some medico-technical investigational procedures, such as interventional radiology, dental procedures, baby deliveries. Using the modified conscious state induced by trance or by conversational hypnosis (thanks to verbal and nonverbal language) allows a better tolerance of these procedures. Only very few situations recommend against this approach.||ENMG is a frequently performed procedure in neurology to explore neuromuscular functions. It implies electric stimulations, needle insertion and needs the patient cooperation and the patient's well-being. This is all the more necessary that this procedure may be repeated for a patient along his/her life.||Only one study evaluated the effect of hypnosis on pain and anxiety during ENMG (Slack and al., 2009). Despite a low statistical power due to a small sample, it showed a reduction of the maximal pain during the needle electromyography.||More proof is therefore needed to assess the efficacity of hypnosis against pain and anxiety during ENMG.||Several members of our nurse and medical team have an experience in hypnosis practice and this procedure is sometimes used in some patients, when specifically required, alone or with other analgesic procedures (like nitrous oxide), but not in the current standard practice. This is mainly useful in patients with anxiety.||This study's principal objective is then to evaluate the effect of an hypnosis procedure, compared to a standard clinical procedure alone, on pain consecutive to ENMG, in patients presenting with anxiety when attending an ENMG. The secondary objective is to assess the effect of hypnosis on anxiety consecutive to the ENMG.||This is a monocentric, controlled, randomized, open-labeled study, with two balanced arms. The study cannot be blind since the members of the staff will apply at the same time the hypnosis procedures and the ENMG investigations.||Patients who have to undergo an ENMG due to their standard care investigations will be consecutively included as long as they're taken care of by members of the staff with an hypnosis experience and express any anxiety.||48 patients in each group will have to be include to achieve a sufficient power.||Statistical analyses will be blindly performed by our methodology, biostatistics and data management unit.

"Effectivness of Distraction by Electric ride-on Cars for Peri Operative Anxiety in Ambulatory Pediatric Surgery, Peri operative anxiety is one of major issues of pediatric anesthesia. Our efforts to decrease children anxiety improve pain, agitation ans behavioral changes during post operative period. Guidelines in pediatric anesthesia are to take into account anxiety in order to enhance recovery after anesthesia and to develop ambulatory surgery.||Pharmacological and non pharmacological tools are used. Midazolam is a benzodiazepin widely used but its indesirable effects such as paradoxical reactions, prolonged sedation and adverse behavioral changes are a brake to enhance recovery after anesthesia programs. Non pharmacological procedures are more promising (parental presence, behavioral preparation programs and distraction) but their etablishment is time consuming, requiring teaching programs, and changing habits. To our knowledge, distraction with ride-on car has not been studied yet.||Little electric car can carry children aged 2 years and more, it can be driven by children under adult distant command.

"Evaluation of a Cardiac Coherence Session to Reducing Patients' Anxiety During a MRI Examination, Although Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is considered to be biologically safe and painless, the examination is often perceived by patients as difficult to bear, causing a great deal of anxiety due to the various constraints: the upper half of the body, including the head, positioned in a tube with a circumference of approximately 70 cm, relatively long duration, immobilization and even restraint. However, all these conditions are necessary to obtain good quality images, which are essential for the interpretation of the examination for diagnostic purposes by the clinicians.||The anxiety of patients linked to the performance of an MRI examination and its negative effects are documented in the literature. According to some authors, 71% of the professionals surveyed stated that anxiety was a common problem in their MRI centre and 19% stated that it regularly disrupted the examination. It is estimated that 10% of the motion artefacts present on MRI examinations are caused by anxiety-related motor agitation, making image quality difficult to exploit. Thus, every day, many MRI examinations are cancelled, interrupted, or of poor quality due to movement and difficult to interpret. All these examinations must therefore be rescheduled, with delays that can be several months long.||Among these non-drug methods, cardiac coherence seems promising. This method is recent, non-invasive, of short duration, very easy to implement and requires little training for users.||The present study hypothesize that a single session of cardiac coherence, carried out in patients prior to an MRI examination and presenting anxiety in relation to this examination, could make it possible to reduce their level of anxiety and thus improve the course of the examination., cardiac coherence|improving patient management",0

"Project H-COVID: Evaluating Hyper-Brief, Online Materials During the COVID-19 Pandemic, Elevations in state anxiety, when moderate and temporary, serve an adaptive function in pandemic contexts, facilitating health behaviors like self-protection and social distancing. However, for some people elevated state anxiety transitions to anxiety disorders, creating undue suffering and impairment. Nearly 33% of both Wuhan residents and Chinese citizens screened positive for generalized anxiety disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic, with uncontrollable, persistent COVID-19-related worries strongly predicting presence of GAD. Similarly, large surveys indicate that levels of anxiety symptoms are rising among United States citizens.||This finding aligns with a large body of literature indicating stronger perceived control over one's own anxiety buffers against a variety of anxiety disorders. Thus, in the context of COVID-19, there is a pressing need for materials that might strengthen perceived control over anxiety, thereby reducing risk for anxiety disorder onset. Ideally, such materials would (1) in no way undermine positive health behaviors, like social distancing, and (2) have capacity for broad-scale, immediate accessibility. Internet-based interventions may particularly valuable during the pandemic stage of COVID-19 due to the need for social distancing, and they have already scaled up to address needs in China. However, drop out from internet-based interventions can be up to 83% and intervention engagement is a frequent issue. Fortunately, single-session experiences (SSEs) can improve mental health related outcomes with similar effect sizes as multi-session therapies, and pilot data from our team suggests they can increase general perceived control (within-group dz = 0.70).||The goal of this project is to test a web-based platform where people can confidentially access and provide feedback on brief activities, called 'single-session experiences' (SSEs), which are about 8 minutes in length, entirely self-administered, and computer-based (Contain COVID Anxiety and Project Remain COVID Free). Previous activities following the same best practices as these experiences have been shown to be safe to complete; predicted significant reductions in psychological distress; and are entirely self-administered. We will recruit a weighted-probability sample of the United States through Prolific's online platform, N = 500. All data collected from the SSEs will be confidential, and the only identifiable information that will be recorded is the participants' Prolific ID to facilitate compensation, which will be deleted from the data after the compensation has been paid. Those that choose to complete the activities have the option to submit their advice to their peers and have it posted anonymously to the web-based platform. This will provide people with an option for an easily accessible activity designed to promote healthy coping skills and resilience in a welcoming environment through which they can learn with others and share experiences., 0",0

Written informed consent will be obtained from each enrolled subject after providing detail regarding the objectives, duration, and purpose of the study.||Interventions:||The experimental intervention (EMG, RESP, and TEMP Biofeedback):||For this study, we will be using the Alive Pioneer with the GP8 Amp. GP8 Amp can record ECG Heart Rate, EMG for muscle tension, Hand Temperature and Skin conductance. Subjects in this group will get EMG, RESP, and TEMP biofeedback intervention training.||Electromyography Biofeedback (EMG) The surface EMG disposable sticky sensors will be attached to the bicep or flexor muscle. The ground sensor will be attached to subjects' fingertips to read the heart rate. A conductive paste, such as Ten20 Conductive Paste, can be used to improve the connection on hairy areas. The electrodes can be placed one right after another. Attach the white, black, and green lines from the GP8 Amp to the disposable electrodes, in order to see the EMG signals.||Respiration Biofeedback (RESP) In this training the GP8 Amp Reparation belt will be used. The Respiration Belt is placed around the abdomen or chest to measure the subject breathing. As the subject breathe, the belt stretches slightly, and this stretch (near the middle of the belt) is measured. The respiration data is shown as a yellow line in the breath pacer area in the Alive Bottom Graphs. The yellow respiration line shows how the subject breathing affects his/her heart rate and smoothness.||Temperature Biofeedback (TEMP) As suggested that temperature in the hand increases when one get relax. Using GP8 Amp, we can teach the subjects to increase their hand temperature dramatically. The temperature sensor is attached to the GP8 Amp in the mini-USB slot nearest the 4 leads. The other end of temperature sensor will be placed in the subject finger, using one of the skin conductance Velcro finger straps to hold the temperature sensor in place. It will take 30 seconds to 1 minute for temperature to calibrate, until the temperature measured stops increasing, then the training begins.||The sequence of the biofeedback training sessions is given below:||The training consists of a total of 8 sessions for every individual with 2 sessions per week over the duration of 4 weeks.|Each session will be approximately of 1 to 1.30 hour.|Subjects will be given clear instructions to not to use chocolate, coffee, tea and cocoa drinks at least 3 hours before the training session.|Since it is suggested that Anxiety tends to change with time so we might consider a one-month pretreatment measure as well as a just before treatment measure.

"Attention Training for Underserved Youth With Anxiety, The main aim of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability of a computerized attention training program for children who have clinically elevated anxiety. Youth from a rural Latino community, with significant anxiety symptoms (N = 52) will be randomized to an active attention bias modification program (AMP) for four weeks or to an attention control condition (nonactive) for four weeks. Families will be assessed at baseline, mistreatment, post-treatment and 3 month followup. AMP responders will be determined by reduction on a self-report measure of anxiety and a clinician administered assessment. Community health workers (promotoras) will be trained to administer the program to youth. Data will be gathered to examine the feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability of this type of treatment and this mode of service delivery. It is hypothesized that the AMP will be feasible, tolerable, and acceptable to this underserved community sample of ethnic minority youth.||Study Design: Following ascertainment of study eligibility and completion of baseline assessment, youth will be assigned to four weeks of AMP or ACC (attention control condition). All youngsters and their families will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment and be reassessed at mistreatment, treatment endpoint (week 4) and 3 month followup.||Screening: Youth will be recruited through various mechanisms.||Flyers will be posted in primary care clinics in Imperial Valley and Los Angeles County. Clinicas de Salud del Pueblo is a private, non-profit corporation providing primary care services throughout Imperial County. Flyers will be posted in the 10 primary care clinics, located in Imperial County.|The second method for recruiting subjects will be through physician referral from providers within the primary care systems. Prior to the study start, all pediatricians/providers will receive information about the study, symptoms of child anxiety, and the use of a short screening measure to assist in detecting child anxiety.

Alternatively, providers, if able, can also ask parents to sign a consent to contact form, giving the research team permission to contact them directly to discuss the study.|Providers may also chose to refer the patient to the study promotora who will assist will explaining the study to the participant, screening, and consenting the participants.|Flyers will also be posted at Sun Valley Behavioral Medical Center, a private medical clinic that serves the medical and mental health needs of children, adolescents and adults in Imperial County. In this case, parents will be expected to call our research team for more information.|The co-PI on this study, Dr. Denise Chavira has an ongoing school based study being conducted with high school students in Imperial Valley. Given that this study covers a range of ages (8-17), we will also recruit from high schools. As part of the existing consent form (for protocol 14-000663), students are asked to check the box if they are interested in participating in future research studies. We will contact those students who have indicated interest in future studies to discuss the current project.||In all of these methods, the community health worker/promotora/e will contact the parent to conduct an initial screen. Thereafter the promotora and/or research coordinator will arrange an in person meeting with the parent and youth to review the consent with the parent and assent form with the youth and administer the eligibility measures. The initial eligibility assessments will not be conducted until all consent/assent forms have been signed and returned to the research team.||At the end of the eligibility visits, the PIs (Chavira and Chang) will review the questionnaires to determine final eligibility. Those who are eligible will process to the baseline visit where they will receive the AMP or ACC program as well as other measures. We have included a table of these measures as well as the assessment schedule in 10.1 section 1.0.||Attention Modification Program: AMP is a modified version of the dot-probe paradigm similar to the original task used by MacLeod, Mathews, and Tata. Each trial begins with a fixation cross presented in the center of the computer screen for 500 ms. The cross is then replaced by a pair of faces presented in the center of the screen for 500 ms. The face pair disappears and a probe (i.e., the letter ""E"" or ""F"") appears immediately in the location of one of the two faces. Participants will be instructed to decide whether the letter is an E or an F and press the corresponding mouse button. The letter probe will remain on the screen until the participant responds. Response latencies to identify the probe will be recorded from the onset of the presentation of the letter probe to the button press. A total of 288 training trials will be delivered each session. This paradigm has been modified to facilitate an attention bias away from threatening material. In this case, the probe always replaces the neutral face. Thus, although there will be no specific instruction to direct attention away from the threatening face, on all trials, the position of the neutral face will indicate the position of the probe.||Attention Control Condition: Like AMP, the attention control condition is a dot-probe task that begins with a fixation cross presented in the computer screen for 500ms, is followed by a pair of faces (one neutral, one threatening) for 500ms, and then a trial is completed when the face pair disappears and a probe (letter ""E"" or ""F"") appears in the location of one of the two faces. Participants will be instructed to decide whether the letter is an E or an F and press the corresponding mouse button. The letter probe will remain on the screen until the participant responds. Response latencies to identify the probe will be recorded from the onset of the presentation of the letter probe to the button press. A total of 288 training trials will be delivered each session. However, in this case, the probe replaces both the neutral and threat face 50% of the time.||Assessment. All parents and children enrolled in the study will complete assessments at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment and 3 month followup. Assessments will focus on feasibility outcomes and clinical outcome measures. Further, measures of moderating factors will be included in order to better understand variables (e.g., poverty, attention control, acculturation) that may suggest trends in differential treatment response within the two conditions., attention training, youth, latino",0

The plant is comprised of a variety of components, such as phytocannabinoids, which include (among others) the major intoxicating constituent of cannabis, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and cannabidiol (CBD), a major non-intoxicating constituent of cannabis. Increasing evidence indicates that CBD in particular may have significant medicinal properties and benefits; experimental studies in both animals and humans have demonstrated that CBD can act as an anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, and muscle relaxant. Several studies have demonstrated that CBD produces acute anxiolytic effects in animals and humans, although thus far no clinical trials of CBD have been conducted in patients with anxiety. As a growing number of states are legalizing medical cannabis, a gap exists in the scientific literature regarding the effects of CBD on anxiety.||This investigation is composed of two stages. Stage 1 is comprised of a four-week, open-label clinical trial of a high-CBD containing compound in individuals with anxiety. Participants will be pre-screened by phone in order to evaluate their eligibility for the study. If approved, participants will come to the hospital for a baseline/screening visit, and will complete a structured clinical interview, clinical and quality of life questionnaires, and cognitive assessments. Enrolled participants will be given CBD solution to use for the duration of the study; participants will be instructed to self-administer 1 milliliter (ml) of the tincture under the tongue three times per day for four weeks. Throughout the treatment period, participants will return to the hospital on a weekly basis to complete questionnaires about their mood and quality of life. Participants will also return to the hospital for a final visit after four weeks of treatment to complete additional questionnaires and cognitive assessments. Stage 1 of the study was completed in early 2020.||Stage 2 of the study is a double-blind clinical trial of this solution in patients with anxiety. This double-blind trial began after the open-label trial was completed. In the same manner as the open-label trial, participants will be pre-screened by phone, and approved participants will come to the hospital for a baseline/screening visit to complete a structured clinical interview, questionnaires, and cognitive assessments. Eligible participants will also have the option to complete an hour-long MRI scan at the baseline and final visits. Enrolled participants will receive either full-spectrum CBD solution, single-compound CBD solution, or placebo solution to self-administer throughout the four week treatment period, as described above. Participants will return to the hospital weekly during the treatment period to complete questionnaires about their mood and quality of life. Participants in this stage of the study will also return for a final visit after four weeks of treatment to complete additional questionnaires, cognitive assessments, and an optional hour-long MRI scan. We are currently recruiting for Stage 2 of the study., 0",0
"Progressive Muscle Relaxation and Nature Sounds in Nursing Students, Background: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of PMR and nature sounds on nursing students' BPM skills, and anxiety levels and vital signs.||Methods: This was a randomized controlled experimental study conducted at the nursing department of the faculty of health sciences of a university. PMR participants rested for ten minutes between the sessions and then practiced PMR for 15 minutes. PMR consisted of taking a deep breath five times and then clenching fists, raising the shoulders, bringing the forearms towards the body, stretching the triceps muscle, and tensing and relaxing the forehead, eye, chin, neck, chest, abdomen, back, hips, thigh, and feet muscles. The investigators made a video of exercises in a certain order and uploaded it to the television in the lab prior to the intervention. The investigators turned on the video during the intervention and asked the participants to follow the instructions for PMR exercises. PMR+NS participants practiced PMR accompanied by nature sounds., Skill training|Nursing students|Anxiety|Blood Pressure Measurement Skills",0
"Respiratory Dysregulation and Breathing Training in Anxious Outpatients, In clinic testing and outside the clinic testing, we will assess the prevalence of respiratory dysregulation in a sample of 60 non-psychotic, not currently alcohol or drug abusing veteran outpatients from our MHC (Mental Hygiene Clinic) who experience episodic anxiety but who do not qualify and have never qualified for the diagnosis of PD (panic disorder). These patients will be compared to 30 patients who are not clinically anxious. Of these 60 anxious patients, 30 will be randomly assigned to a 4-week course of breathing training assisted by feedback of end-tidal pCO2 levels as an augmentation of their current treatment. They will be compared to 30 who simply will continue with their current treatment (TAU). The breathing training group will receive clinical and physiological assessments immediately before the treatment period, four weeks after the end of the treatment period, and at a 4-month follow-up. The TAU group will be assessed three times at equivalent intervals, and if they wish, may undergo breathing training after the third assessment. Treatment will take place mainly in the first two years, giving us adequate time for follow-up and data analysis. We expect that this therapy will be especially effective for treating anxiety in the patients with substantial respiratory dysregulation., Anxiety|Breathing Training|Respiratory Dysregulation",0
"Cranial Electro Therapy Stimulation in Reducing Perioperative Anxiety, CES Alpha-Stim is a non-invasive device which has been in place and has been approved for patients to reduce anxiety by the FDA. This study involves the use of CES Alpha-Stim device applied to the patient 30 minutes before and through-out cataract surgery procedure and then to measure the level of anxiety and discomfort by using a visual analog scale (VAS). We propose that by applying the device the patients will be able to have markedly less level of anxiety and discomfort before and during the surgery and will ultimately avoid the traditional use of sedative or analgesic drugs being used for these kinds of surgery., Cranial Electro Stimulation|First Eye Cataract Surgery|Preoperative sedation|Perioperative sedation",0

"Assessing Patient Anxiety During Mohs Micrographic Surgery, There has been a continual increase in cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer and melanoma over the last several decades. With the increase in incidence, there is also the need for increased treatment. Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is highly efficacious, with cure rates in the upper 90% for both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, the two most common forms of skin cancer. MMS is used for tumors in cosmetically sensitive areas or areas of recurrence.||While MMS is usually performed in the outpatient setting, it may be an anxiety provoking experience for patients, ranging from the fear of a cancer diagnosis, to concerns about the procedural events of the surgery and associated pain, to the anticipation of their final cosmetic result. During a MMS procedure, unlike many other types of surgery or procedures, the patient is awake and aware of his or her surroundings, with periods of waiting interspersed throughout the procedure. Such aspects can lead to the high level of perioperative anxiety in MMS patients. The effects of listening to music, watching preoperative informational videos, and the use of web-based applications have been used to attempt to decrease anxiety in MMS patients. However, causes for differences in anxiety level between first time MMS patients and patients returning for a subsequent MMS procedure are not well characterized.||One approach to reduce patient anxiety involves patient education, where patients are presented statistics about the small likelihood of complication from the MMS procedure. However, patients interpret these data very subjectively. The study team proposes an alternative approach to patient education through patient vignettes. A previous study explored using a narrative video that included patient testimonials, but this video also used patient-physician interaction and drawings. In this study, patients will be provided short vignettes, that would include information about the experience of a typical MMS patient., Mohs Micographic Surgery|skin cancer|melanoma",0

"MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for Anxiety Associated With a Life-Threatening Illness, Individuals facing, or who have faced, a life-threatening illness contend with more than just the physical symptoms of their condition and may experience anxiety, depression, anger, and despair that can exacerbate their distress. Research suggests that diagnosis of, and living with a life-threatening illness can result in symptoms similar to those seen in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).||3,-4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a monoamine releaser with a unique pharmacological profile that include decreased feelings of fear, increased positive mood and increased interpersonal trust. Findings from clinical trials in people with PTSD and anecdotal reports suggest that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may assist people who have anxiety related to having a life-threatening illness.||This Phase 2 pilot study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 18 participants comparing the effects of MDMA-assisted therapy vs. placebo with therapy. Thirteen participants were randomized to the active dose condition of 125 mg of MDMA (plus an optional supplemental dose of 62.5 mg MDMA) with therapy and five participants were randomized to the placebo with therapy condition. The study will consist of two blinded experimental sessions of MDMA-assisted therapy or placebo with therapy, each session lasting six to eight hours and scheduled two to four weeks apart. Each participant will be unblinded one month after their second experimental session in Stage 1. After unblinding, participants receiving MDMA will complete a third open-label experimental session of MDMA-assisted therapy and participants who originally received placebo will have the opportunity to cross over to open-label Stage 2 and receive active MDMA-assisted therapy in 3 sessions.||The primary objective of the study is to assess changes in trait anxiety in subjects receiving active dose MDMA compared to those receiving placebo as measured by State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) Trait scores from Baseline to the Primary Endpoint (one month after the second experimental session)., Anxiety|MDMA|Life-threatening illness|Therapy",0

"Android Mobile Devices to Assist Routine Anticipation for Autistic Children, Autism is a disorder characterized by social deficits, and among others by changes in communication. The diagnosis of this disorder remains accomplished by direct assessment the individual's behavior, according to specific clinical criteria present the classification systems of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV). Therapists teach autistic to communicate with the help of symbols and auxiliary anticipation and communication routines, usually using the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), or photos. However these are presented in transition PECS cards and do not follow the children in activities that develop outside the school environment. The objective of this work is to develop an application to run on a mobile device Android tablet that features the visual routines.||In this way the routines can be accessed outside the school environment. This technology is easy to use and facilitates data entry by touching the screen, was developed using the Unified Modeling Language (UML), Javascript, Apache Web server and Web browser Chrome. The application validation, will be held with 10 autistic and 2 teachers from the center of inclusion and support for autistic. Teachers should insert the activities programmed for each autistic student. Tablet in student performance in communicating with this tablet will be measured. Parents or guardians knowledge with the PECS system will be trained and will be evaluated on their autonomy inserting images, audio and subtitles.

"Brain Plasticity of Autism in Response to Early Behavioral Intervention: A Multimodal MRI Study, Autism is a well-recognized neurodevelopmental disorder severely affecting the health of children. While the unclear neurobiological basis of autism and the lack of effective medication, the most commonly used approach for treatment is behavioral intervention. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the intervention therapy remains incompletely understood. The current project aims to explore the impacts of different early behavioral intervention methods on brain plasticity of autism using multimodal MRI technique and provide guidelines for the intervention and treatment of autism by evaluating the efficiency of these methods. Investigators first investigate longitudinal effect of behavioral intervention on brain structure and function in children with autism. In addition, investigators provide new biological indexes upon multimodal large-scale brain connectomes to evaluate the curative effect of intervention. Finally, investigators propose a prediction model of intervention effect based on multimodal multivariate pattern analysis methods. Furthermore, investigators expect to map the state-of-the-art biomarkers on multi-modal networks to provide a new interpretation of pathophysiological mechanisms of autism., autism|Brain Plasticity|Behavioral Intervention|Magnetic Resonance Imaging",1

"Examination of Differential Valuation of Leisure Items and Attention as Reinforcers in Children With Autism, The three core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are impairments in social interaction, restricted range of interest, and stereotyped/repetitive behavior. However, autism is a heterogeneous disorder, and individuals with a diagnosis vary widely in specific presentation. For example, despite an overall impairment in social behavior, some individuals with an autism diagnosis still frequently initiate social interactions with others. In contrast, others may engage in problem behaviors maintained by escape or avoidance of social interactions.||A progressive ratio (PR) assessment is one method for directly quantifying the degree to which an individual values a particular stimulus or event. Within a PR assessment, reinforcement occurs under schedule requirements that increase following each set of responses within a single session until responding ceases. The highest schedule requirement completed (i.e., breakpoint) can then be used as a measure of how much an individual is willing to respond for a given stimulus.||The study will include about 65 children, 25 children with ASD and 15 typically developing children, and 25 children with developmental disabilities other than ASD. Children with autism, typically developing children, and children with non-ASD developmental delays other than ASD will be compared in terms of how they value social attention and toys. The child participants will be asked to do an action, such as pressing a button, to receive either an item or attention. At first, the participants will only be required to do the action once, but after the first time the children will be required do more and more before they can get the item or attention. Eventually, most children stop responding for the preferred item or attention. The study will consider the child as done working when they go for one minute without performing the action. Sessions will end after 30 minutes if the child keeps working without stopping. This study will examine how many times the child will respond for items and attention. 15 of the children with ASD will be asked to come back for an additional appointment one week after they complete the assessment of how they value attention and toys. The PR assessment will be repeated see if the children respond the same way at different times.||The second part of the study will include 10 children diagnosed with ASD ranging in age from two to six. All of the procedures described in part one of the study will be included. The PR assessment will be completed prior to intervention and again after intervention. All appointments will be conducted over a maximum of 4 weeks. The intervention will be based on the principals of respondent conditioning; social interaction will be paired with the delivery of other reinforcers, such as edible items, to increase the value of social interaction. Sessions will be conducted 5 days per week and will be up to two hours long.

"Effectiveness of Atomoxetine in Treating ADHD Symptoms in Children and Adolescents With Autism, Autism is a developmental disorder that can cause severe and pervasive impairment in thinking, feeling, language, and the ability to relate to others. It is usually first diagnosed in early childhood. Children with autism demonstrate repetitive behaviors or interests and deficits in social interaction, verbal communication, and nonverbal communication. In addition, they often have unusual responses to sensory experiences, such as certain sounds or the way objects look. Some symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, are also associated with autism. Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is used to treat ADHD. It works differently, however, than stimulant drugs and may help to reduce ADHD symptoms in children with autism. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of atomoxetine in treating children with ADHD symptoms associated with autism.||Potential participants will first attend a screening visit, which will include a psychiatric diagnostic interview, a practice session for swallowing pill capsules, a physical exam, an electrocardiogram (ECG), a blood test, and an assessment of pubertal stage. Females of childbearing age will also undergo a urine pregnancy test. In an initial double-blind study phase, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive either atomoxetine or placebo for 8 weeks. A baseline visit will include several rating scales, observations, and an interview to assess adaptive functioning. These measures and procedures will be used to keep track of symptoms, side effects, and behavior that could change during the study. Children who are assigned to placebo and do not notice an improvement in their ADHD symptoms will be given the opportunity to receive atomoxetine at the end of 8 weeks.

"Treatment With Acetyl-Choline Esterase Inhibitors in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a group of developmental disorders of brain function resulting in a distinct phenotype, most probably related to many specific causes. Individuals with a disorder in the autism spectrum are a heterogeneous group of patients with early childhood onset of deficits in social interaction, communication and language, and repetitive and stereotypic behaviors. ASD has become increasingly prevalent during the last few decades (Wiznitzer, 2005).||The neuro-anatomical substrate of ASD has been the subject of intense investigation, but current findings are inconclusive, limited and sometimes even contradictory.||Medical treatment of autism is still a matter of dispute. Medications used are mainly aimed to treat the comorbid symptoms, such as epilepsy, tics, obsessive-compulsive or hyperactive behaviors (Wiznitzer, 2005). Although many efforts were invested in establishing a model of autistic pathophysiology, no such model is currently accepted, and there is no evidence for an efficient treatment of the core autistic symptoms (Wiznitzer, 2005).||Previous studies indicate that many brain systems are involved in the expression of autism.

"Intranasal Oxytocin in the Treatment of Autism, Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by abnormalities in speech and communication, impaired social functioning, and repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. A number of researchers have suggested that the neuropeptide oxytocin may be implicated in the etiology of autism.||Given the likely possibility of dysregulated oxytocin in autism, the goal of this pilot study is to investigate the long-term therapeutic effects of oxytocin in the treatment of autism. One practical issue with oxytocin is that it does not exist in a pill form. Only the intravenous form is available in the United States and this form may or may not pass the blood-brain barrier. In addition, intravenous oxytocin is not practical for treatment studies. One alternative is intranasal oxytocin; this form of administration is known to pass the blood-brain barrier, and it is easy for participants to self-administer. Although not available in the United States, we are in the process of receiving an Investigational New Drug exemption for its use and can import it from Europe.||Thus, this pilot investigation will explore daily intranasal oxytocin in the treatment of autism. Also, there are very few, if any, outcome measures to assess social functioning in the ""real world"" in the context of clinical trials; yet, this is a major target for intervention, especially in autism. Thus, a final goal of this study will be to explore the use of Event Contingent Recording to index changes in social functioning and affect. Event Contingent Recording is a methodology developed by personality/social psychologists, which allows participants to report on symptoms, affect, and behavior close in time to experience. In addition, to enabling more sensitive assessments, this methodology allows for the assessment of more diverse (e.g., at home versus work) and more detailed measurements of mood and behavior.||Finally, a portion of this study aims to perform gene expression profiling using fresh whole blood to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying oxytocin therapy and oxytocin efficacy in adults with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. The systemic effects of oxytocin therapy and the molecular basis for a positive treatment response to oxytocin are not well understood. An understanding of the former may help predict those persons who may suffer side-effects from treatment and the latter may help provide easily accessible peripheral biomarkers that could predict treatment response., Autism|Treatment|Oxytocin|Adults|Autism Spectrum Disorder",1
"A Trial of CM-AT in Children With Autism With All Levels of FCT (The Blum Study), Autism is clearly a significant cause of disability in the pediatric population. Many children with Autism exhibit impaired protein digestion which may or may not manifest in self-restricted diets. The inability to digest protein affects the availability of essential amino acids in the body. CM-AT is designed to enhance protein digestion thereby potentially restoring the pool of essential amino acids. Essential amino acids play a critical role in the expression of several genes important to neurological function and serve as precursors to key neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. CM-AT is a proprietary enzyme that is designed as a granulated powder taken three times daily., Autism",1
"Investigation of Neuroserpin as an Autism Candidate Gene, It is proposed to perform a pilot study to ask whether genetic variation at SERPINI1 is contributing to idiopathic autism. To maximize the chance of finding such variants, the perseveration and language delay endophenotypes (simpler intermediate traits) will be used to select twenty autistic multiplex (and if necessary singleplex) families with idiopathic autistic patients who have been evaluated with the Autism Diagnostic Interview-revised (ADI-R) and their nuclear families ( siblings and their parents) will be identified by Dr. Liptak and Dr. Lebel with the assistance of Ms Klausner and recruited. Patients with syndromic autism due to known causes such as fragile X syndrome, Tuberous sclerosis, Down syndrome, and Neurofibromatosis type I will be excluded. The entire SERPINI1 coding region (nine exons), one kilobase of promoter region (Chen, 2007) and at least 200 bp of intron flanking each exon will be sequenced in an index case and the segregation of mutations identified investigated within the families. All mutations that appear to be good functional candidates will be compared in frequency amongst autistic and control populations in order to determine if a case can be made that SERPINI1 could be contributing to autism. In addition, known neuroserpin SNPs identified through the Hapmap project (www.hapmap.org) will be investigated and tested for evidence of transmission distortion/disequilibrium by linkage/association analysis. Depending on the results from this initial experiment it is proposed to subsequently sequence up to a further 80 local autism patients (maximum of 100 patients). Additional studies would be performed as follow up studies to similarly sequence the genes of other serpins expressed in the brain; Plasminogen activator 1, PA1, SERPINE1 located at the MLS linkage peak at 7q22.1 seen in IMGSAC study (Lamb, 2002) while Proteinase nexin 1, PN1 SERPINE2 at 2q36.1,close to previously identified linkage peaks (Autism Genome Project consortium, 2007) and potentially their putative serine protease targets (tPA at 8p11.21 and uPA at 10q22.2) and the upstream neuroserpin activators (ALK6, AMH and BMP2) (Lebeurrier, 2008). tPA expression is increased by events that require synaptic plasticity (Yepes, 2002) and enhances NMDA receptor signaling by cleavage of its NR1 subunit (Pawlack, 2002).

"Sulforaphane-rich Broccoli Sprout Extract for Autism, Behavioral improvements occur transiently during febrile illnesses in autism, and include decreased repetitive behaviors and improved speech. These changes have been recorded in 38% of autistic children in a clinical survey and 83% in an observational study, respectively. The cellular basis for this ""fever effect"" is unknown but is likely to involve heat shock proteins (HSP) and cellular stress responses (CSR) that lead to changes in synaptic function and network connectivity.||Sulforaphane (1-isothiocyanato-4R- (methylsulfinyl)butane) is an isothiocyanate that is delivered by lyophilized extracts of 3-day-old broccoli sprouts. Broccoli sprouts are widely consumed as a food item all over the world by very large numbers of individuals, without any reports of adverse effects. Our preliminary work in vitro shows that sulforaphane stimulates HSP and mitochondrial biogenesis in several genetic disorders.||This study of sulforaphane-rich Broccoli Sprout Extract in autism is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II single site trial, designed to ensure safety and obtain efficacy data, with a focus on changes in social responsiveness, a core feature of autism.

"Fluoxetine Essay in Children With Autism, Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests. The population prevalence of autism is approximately 1 in 1000 (GILLBERG and WING, 1999) and the ratio of affected males to females is 4:1 (FOMBONNE, 1999). Although typically considered a childhood disorder, most persons with autism experience marked functional impairment throughout their lives. Follow-up studies of children with autism show that only 5%-10% become independent as adults, 25% progress but still require supervision, and the remaining continue to be severely impaired and in need of institutionalized care (WING, 1989). Thus, the syndrome represents a substantial public health problem with tragic cost to the individual, the family, and the community.||It is a randomized, double blind flexible dose study with parallel groups, controlled, fluoxetine versus placebo.||The final efficacy evaluation will be done after 6 months of treatment; Nine obligatory visits are planned Patients will be assessed at the following visits: base-line inclusion (D-15), and 2, 4, ,12, ,20, 22, 24 25, 26 weeks.

"Treatment for Children With Autism and Anxiety, Children with ASD and anxiety in our initial studies have displayed reductions in anxiety symptoms following the delivery of the FYF intervention. Given these initial successes, there are two primary purposes of this study. First, to train outpatient clinicians to fidelity on the FYF intervention for 8-14 year old children with high-functioning ASD and clinical anxiety. Second, to develop an optimal training model for learning the FYF intervention. The primary aims of Phase 1 are to develop a training manual and deliver a workshop on the FYF model to a group of outpatient clinicians in preparation for the clinicians to deliver the FYF intervention to four groups of children with ASD and anxiety. In Phase 2, the primary aims include comparing three instruction methods of learning to clinicians at three different outpatient clinics, by assessing increases in clinicians' acquisition of the intervention techniques and estimating the degree of reduction in anxiety symptoms on the primary outcome measures for the children with ASD. Instruction methods are: a) Manual, b) Workshop, c) Workshop-Plus. We hypothesize that clinicians receiving the Workshop-Plus (workshop plus ongoing consultation) condition will achieve treatment fidelity at a faster rate than clinicians receiving the other two instruction methods, and the children with ASD in the Workshop-Plus condition will display greater reductions in anxiety symptoms compared to the children in the other two conditions., 0",1

"Fluvoxamine and Sertraline in Childhood Autism - Does SSRI Therapy Improve Behaviour and/or Mood?, Autism is a neuropsychiatric disorder diagnosed in early childhood. Approximately 10 Canadian children per 10 000 live births suffer from the disorder, which is three to four times more common in males than in females. It is characterized by social and and communicative deficits and restricted, repetitive interests and behaviours. Most autistic children are delayed in the acquisition of both verbal and non-verbal communication skills and many never develop useful language. Three-quarters of autistic children have mild to severe mental retardation and a quarter develop seizures during later childhood or adolescence. Its etiology is heterogenous and there is no cure. Although behaviour therapy is an important tool in management, pharmacotherapy remains a necessity for many children. Current therapy is limited to antipsychotic drugs that can carry an unacceptable risk of chronic neurotoxicity (tardive dyskinesia) or tricyclic antidepressants that have undesireble cardiovascular effects. This study proposes to evaluate the potential benefit of selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in autism.||All autistic children whose symptoms are not currently well controlled will be offered entry into the trial.

"The Effects of a Clean Room Sleeping Environment on Elemental and Chemical Concentrations in Children With Autism, Autism spectrum disorders are characterized behaviorally by expressive language and social deficits, the performance of stereotypic and repetitive behavior patterns, and abnormal cognitive functioning. Children with autism spectrum disorders often do not have known anomalies seen on genetic testing. An emerging paradigm suggests that the majority of children with autism are displaying a pattern of genetic / environmental interaction that make them susceptible to difficulties with detoxification of the heavy metal and chemical environment. Children with autism demonstrate increased difficulty with the performance of methylation and sulfation required for the elimination of fat soluble chemicals from human tissues. These children also commonly display dysfunction of their metalloprotein systems necessary for the elimination of heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic from their bodies.||This study sought to provide 10 children with autism an opportunity to sleep in a clean room environment, a hospital room that was modified to remove nearly all traces of particulate matter, chemicals, and heavy metals, for a 2 week period while going about their normal activities during the day. In the clean room, the children slept on bedding and wore clothes that did not release any toxins. This room created a concentration gradient for chemical and heavy metal toxins that may have allowed these toxins to leave the children's bodies during their stays.||The children's parents filled out seven rating scales, including the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, immediately before and after the 2 week sleeping periods. The children had blood samples taken before and after the 2 week sleeping experiences that measured biomarkers of metalloprotein (heavy metal elimination) and immune functioning, such as the plasma zinc/serum copper ratio and T and B cell subsets. Red blood cell and hair concentrations of toxic heavy metals such as mercury, arsenic, and chromium 6, and red blood cell concentrations of chemicals implicated in contributing to human pathology, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diethyl ethers (PBDEs), and phthalates were determined before and after the sleeping experiences. These pre and post stay variables were statistically compared, and it was hypothesized that the children's red blood cell concentrations of toxins would be significantly reduced while their hair concentrations of toxins would be significantly increased after their sleeping experiences in the clean room, supporting the concept that the clean room promoted the release of heavy metals and chemicals from their bodies.

"The Effectiveness of an Autistic-delivered Peer-support Intervention for Autistic Adults: Community Autism Peer Specialist (CAPS) Program, Approximately 5.4 million adults in the United States (1 in 45) are believed to have autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but there is a lack of services available to support them in reaching their full potential. Although typically conceptualized as a childhood disorder, ASD-related service needs persist into adulthood. The core social and communication impairments of ASD, reported difficulties with change, and a high rate of co-occurring mental health conditions often result in limited participation in major life areas that are determinants of health, including social and community participation, employment, housing, and transportation. The transition to adulthood is not only associated with developmental challenges, but also a ""services cliff"" whereby supports and services that were previously available through the education system are no longer available. Peer-delivered interventions have emerged as a potent, evidence-based modality for enhancing outcomes among other clinical populations, such as adults with serious mental illnesses, with effectiveness in enhancing social networks, empowering participants, reducing the use of inpatient services, and increasing life satisfaction. At present, there is limited research on the effectiveness of autistic-led peer support interventions, especially those that target broad aspects of community functioning. The proposed study seeks to refine, manualize, and test a pilot autistic peer support program aimed at supporting community participation among autistic young adults, with the goal of preparing it for large-scale testing and future dissemination and sustainability. The first aim of this proposal is to enhance the structure of a pilot autistic-peer delivered intervention (Community Autism Peer Specialists, or CAPS) that is currently in use as a Medicaid-reimbursed service in Philadelphia. This will include developing a manual and fidelity tool to facilitate evaluation and systematic implementation. The second and third aims are to conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial with 40 young autistic adults to test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and research procedures, while also examining proposed target mechanisms of action (e.g., self-efficacy, working alliance, perceived social support) and clinical outcomes such as community participation, loneliness, and resilience. This work will gather additional evidence and implementation information to support a fully-powered R01- funded clinical trial. The proposed efforts will involve substantial engagement of a diverse group of autistic adults in all phases along with multiple community partners, including a Medicaid payer. The project has tremendous potential to expand service options for autistic adults and is uniquely poised to have broad, scalable impact., peer support|adult|developmental disabilities|independent living|participation",1

Subsequent to receiving 40 HBOT treatments, each participant will be given a break from HBOT for at least one week, during which time the schedule of behavioral measures will remain the same. If proficiency on the behavioral measures decreases when HBOT is terminated for one week, HBOT may be reinitiated as per the discretion of the physician and parent.||HBOT Systematic Desensitization||Because children with autism often do not tolerate changes in the environment, we anticipate difficulties with initial treatment compliance in some children.

Below are the general desensitization procedures for the participants:||The child is introduced to the mask and therapist models how it is worn|The child is required to hold the un-strapped mask loosely against his/her face until he/she can breathe while holding the mask in place for a minute or more|The child is required to strap the mask on for a minute, with gradual increase to 30+ minutes|The child is seated upright in the chamber with the mask on and the HBOT machine off for a minute, with a gradual increase to 30+ minutes|The child is lying down in the chamber with the mask on and the HBOT machine on at a low pressure setting for a minute, with gradual increase to 30+ minutes|The child has the mask strapped on and lying down, while the HBOT is running for an hour||For some children who exhibit severe noncompliance with the HBOT procedure, relaxation training and listening to preferred music prior to the HBOT procedure may be used.||In order to minimize the influence of learning and attention from parents/therapists during HBOT/placebo sessions, all children will be viewing a developmentally-appropriate DVD (e.g., Disney movie) during all HBOT sessions to minimize confounding effects that may occur with other activities. The viewing of DVDs will continue throughout all 80 sessions and during follow-up.||Procedures Data will be collected according to the following schedule: prior to treatment, following 5, 15, 25, and 40 HBOT treatments, as well as at post-treatment and 1 and 3-month follow-up.||Behavioral Measures Participants who are receiving intensive behavioral intervention services during the course of the study will have continuous measures of many aspects of performance recorded daily, as a part of their behavioral intervention services. Such measures will be customized to the behavioral education needs of each child, but are likely to include, at a minimum: 1) measure of adaptive behavior (e.g., language); 2) measure of aberrant behavior (e.g., tantrums, etc.); and 3) stereotyped behavior. All such continuous measures can be observed throughout the course of the participant's involvement in the study. However, the consideration of any particular continuous measure as part of the current study would require inter-observer agreement data be collected on those measures for a minimum of 25% of the observed data. That is, a second, independent observer must record data on all behavioral clinical measures which will be included in the study. Participants who are not receiving intensive behavioral intervention services will receive only the behavioral measures described below. Participants who are receiving intensive behavioral intervention services during the course of the study will receive the measures described below, as well as any of their clinical behavioral measures for which adequate inter-observer agreement data are collected.||Repeated acquisition task||A defining feature of autism is a global impairment in one's ability to learn. Repeated acquisition tasks are commonly used in drug behavioral pharmacology studies to assess the effect of a drug on the ability of an individual to learn, that is, the efficiency with which the individual's behavior is brought under new forms of stimulus control. Repeated acquisition tasks typically involve the participant learning to respond to a new sequence of positions during each session. For example, four levers or buttons are presented and the participant must press the four buttons in a particular sequence in order to earn reinforcement. However, the correct sequence is different for every session, and typically one session is conducted daily, so the sequence of responding required to earn reinforcement is different each day. The performance of the participant can be analyzed in a number of ways including the percent correct for the entire session, the total number of responses or the number of errors made until 80% correct responding is reached.||The complexity of the task can be adjusted by varying either or both of two parameters: 1) the number of response positions present (e.g., number of buttons present), and 2) the number of responses in the sequence required for reinforcement. For example, ten buttons could be present but the participant is only required to press one particular button out of the ten in order to get reinforcement, versus pressing a sequence of ten which involves each button once, versus having only two buttons present, etc. The standard degree of complexity in behavioral pharmacology research is having four response options present and requiring the participant to respond to all four in a particular order to earn reinforcement.||Delayed matching to sample||An additional cognitive process that might be of interest when evaluating HBOT is short-term memory. A common behavioral measure of short-term memory is a delayed matching-to-sample (DMTS) procedure. In such procedures, a sample stimulus is presented and then removed and a delay occurs between the removal of the sample stimulus and the presentation of two or more comparison stimuli. The participant earns reinforcement for choosing the correct comparison stimulus. The delay between the removal of the sample stimulus and the presentation of the comparison stimuli can vary from zero to any conceivable duration, but typically does not exceed 60 seconds.||The relation between the sample stimulus and the correct comparison stimulus can be varied in order to alter the difficulty of the task. For example, the sample stimulus and the correct comparison stimulus may be identical, often referred to as ""identity matching."" This is the easiest form of DMTS. Alternatively, the sample stimulus may be related to the correct comparison stimulus in an abstract dimension. For example, the sample stimulus may be the written word car and the correct comparison stimulus might be a bicycle, with a gorilla and a fork as distracters.||Sessions can be conducted with a fixed delay or the delay can be systematically increased during the session in order to identify a threshold at which the participant is no longer able to respond correctly. For example, on the first trial, the delay may be zero second and then the delay may be increased by 4 seconds on each subsequent trial, contingent on correct responsse on the previous trial. The data are then analyzed to determine the longest delay at which the participant was consistently correct at 80% accuracy. This threshold can be considered a measure of the participant's short term memory at the time of the session.||Standardized Measures||In addition to the direct measures of behavior described above, standardized intelligence and adaptive assessments will be conducted prior to the initiation of HBOT. These will include:||ADI/ADOS WPPSI-III (2-6 years) /WASI (6+ years) Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) Subjective Questionnaires Aberrant Behavior Checklist Clinical Global Impression ATEC Selected sections of the APEQ BRIEF Parenting Stress Index Repetitive Behavior Scale A side effect questionnaire Thoughtful House Caregiver diary||Laboratory & Physiological Measures Full physical exam (weight, height, vital signs-temperature) Otoscopic examination prior to enrollment in the study||STATISTICAL DESIGN/ANALYSIS||The primary measures will consist of changes in the rate and percentage of change from pre and post HBOT adaptive, aberrant, and stereotyped behaviors.||ADVERSE EFFECTS AND MANAGEMENT: the only 2 most commonly encountered adverse reactions are ear pain and sinus pressure.||Ear Pain: This can be minimized or ameliorated by working on pressure equalization techniques across the tympanic membrane. These techniques include:||Yawning Drinking water/juice Val Salva (Plugging nose and mouth, blowing air out the ears) Jaw thrust and swallowing Bending head to the side and yawning/swallowing. The technician can slow the rate of pressurization allowing adequate time for pressure equalization to occur||Sinus pressure: this can be ameliorated with slowing down the rate of pressurization and depressurization. Also, the administration of 0.5% Neosynephrine intranasally and pseudoephedrine can be used.||Should a serious adverse event occur, the form SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING FORM will be filled out and reported to the IRB office within 5 business days and a written summary of the circumstances surrounding the adverse reaction be submitted to the IRB for review at the next scheduled IRB meeting.||Minor reactions, such as ear pain or sinus pressure will be managed and documented by the physician., Autism|Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy|Behavioral assessments",1
"T-ABA Group Based Early Intervention For Parents of Children With ASD, This is a ten week study. The child will be randomized to one of two treatment groups. Assignment is chosen by chance (like flipping a coin). The two treatment groups are T-ABA (Targeted Applied Behavior Analysis) with parent training and T-ABA with parent training and individual child sessions. For both groups, study procedures will be the same except the T-ABA with parent training and individual child sessions group will receive eight one-to-one Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) individual therapy sessions during the course of the study. Participants in the T-ABA with parent training group will be offered eight one-to-one ABA individual therapy sessions at the conclusion of the study.||During the child's participation in this study families are asked to not make any changes to his or her current neuropsychiatric medications or therapy for two weeks before the study begins and during his or her ten week participation. Medication changes may include increasing or decreasing the dose you receive, changing the time of day the child takes medication, starting a new medication, or discontinuing a current medication. Therapy the child receives may include speech, OT, PT, counseling, play therapy, music therapy, social skills training, special education services, socialization, recreational sports, or nutritional interventions. Therapy changes may include increasing or decreasing how often the child receives therapy, changing who the child receives therapy from, beginning a new therapy or discontinuing a current therapy.||The child will be asked to complete assessments before the start of the study. The child will complete a language assessment and an eye tracking task that will measure his or her attention to different pictures and videos. Families will complete questionnaires that examine the child's medical and family history as well as his or her current symptoms, functioning, and quality of life and families will be given a language collection device. This is like a recorder that will record every time the family or the child talks. Families will place the language collection device in the pocket of the child's clothing and it will record the language environment for two days. Families will return the language collection device to us. To help us better understand your child's medical condition, we will access the child's medical records to collect any previous evaluations and diagnoses.||During weeks 1 through 4, families will attend a parent training group. Each group will be 1.5 hours long and will focus on topics such as discrete trial teaching (breaking skills into small components in order to teach new information to the child), natural environment teaching (using the environment to increase the child's motivation to communicate), assessing and treating challenging behavior, using visual supports and teaching everyday living activities such as drinking from a cup or washing hands. During these groups families will have the opportunity to view examples and practice using the skills discussed.||During week 5, families will attend a parent training group. Families and their children will also be observed and videotaped by study staff for 10 minutes during which they will be asked to use the techniques you learned during the parent group. The video tape will be kept in the child's study file and will only be viewed by study staff as part of the research study. Families will also complete questionnaires that examine the child's medical and family history as well as his or her current symptoms, functioning, and quality of life and will be given a language collection device (like a tape recorder). They will place the language collection device in the pocket of the child's clothing and it will record his or her language and language environment for 2 days. They will return the language collection device to us.||During weeks 6 through 9 families and their children will attend a one-hour weekly parent-therapist session with a study staff member. They will practice using the techniques from the parent group with their child and the study staff member will provide them with coaching and feedback. Families can also bring along specific questions they have.||During week 10, families will attend a parent-therapist session. Families and their children will also be observed and videotaped by study staff for 10 minutes during which they will practice using the techniques from the parent group with their child. They will also complete questionnaires that examine the child's current symptoms, functioning, and quality of life and they will be given a language collection device. They will place the language collection device in the pocket of the child's clothing and it will record his or her language and language environment for 2 days. Families will return the language collection device to us. The child will also complete testing with a study staff. Testing will measure the child's language and attention to pictures and videos during an eye tracking task.||Ten weeks after the study is complete, families and their children will complete the same assessment procedures that were completed during week 10 in order to measure any changes that occurred after the end of the study.||If a family is in the T-ABA with parent training and individual child sessions group, the child will also receive one-to-one ABA therapy sessions during weeks 1 through 4 and 6 through 9. During the one-to-one ABA therapy sessions the child may work with the therapist on skills such as making eye contact when his or her name is called, playing with toys, asking for favorite foods or activities using words or gestures, making choices, taking turns or responding to one-step commands. Study staff will work with families to select programming to be completed with their child during these sessions.||If a family is in the T-ABA with parent training group, they will be asked if they'd like to schedule eight one-to-one ABA therapy sessions at the conclusion of the study (after follow-up assessments have been collected).||Families will receive assessment results in a brief report provided after testing is completed at visits 1, 5, 10 and follow up., Autism|Applied Behavior Analysis",1
"EEG Studies of Sensory Processing in Autistic Children, Specific Aims:||Aim 1: To recruit 75 children with autism and 75 age- and sex-matched controls ages 6 to 8 years old for an electrophysiological study and to characterize the subjects using appropriate instruments for autism diagnosis, language functioning and behavior/sensory profile, and to measure head circumferences Aim 2: To acquire and analyze event-related potential (ERP) data in the auditory and visual modality.||ERP Hypothesis: Increased amplitude, altered morphology, impaired temporal discrimination and delayed responsiveness will be found early in the processing hierarchy, and the severity of these abnormalities will be associated with the severity of dysfunction at higher levels of cortical processing.||Aim 3: To acquire EEG data and to analyze it quantitatively. Quantitative EEG Hypothesis: Both interhemispheric and intrahemispheric coherence measures of the EEG will be significantly deviant from those in the normal sample and predicted by abnormalities of ERPs. In addition, EEG background alpha activity will show post mature (i.e. higher) frequencies (Hz) than would be expected for age and focal epileptiform activity and slowing (i.e. paroxysmal theta) will predict dysfunction on the ERPs.||Rationale:||The goal of this grant is to use electrophysiological measures to characterize abnormalities in gating and timing in the autistic brain. The motivation for this research project derives from findings and models in autism of increased excitation/inhibition ratios, increased brain and white matter volume and altered connectivity. These changes, alone and in combination, have the potential to alter the intensity, timing and integration of signaling at multiple stages of processing. These signaling problems can potentially lead to the autistic behavioral phenotype through cognitive processing abnormalities including the hyperspecificity/overselectivity of autism, as well as to such features of autism as sensory processing abnormalities, seizures, and anxiety. We believe that characterizing abnormalities related to gating and timing phenomena may lead to the development of an electrophysiological battery that can be utilized for early diagnosis, prognosis and subtyping of autism, as well as the tracking of treatment efficacy.||Subjects:||Subjects will be recruited from the general population, the Ladders Clinic at MGH/Spaulding Hospital, where the PI, Dr. Martien, is employed as a clinician, as well as from the clinical practice of Dr. Herbert at the MGH-Institute of Health Professions preschool clinic. Flyers will be placed on available bulletin boards at the two clinics and throughout the greater Boston area, particularly at all Partners, Harvard, MIT, hospital, clinic, research, and educational settings.||The study will seek to enroll eighty 75, 6 to 8 year olds with autism and 75 age and sex matched controls. Children will be considered for inclusion in the autism group if:||English is the primary language in the home|Experimental group: Child meets criteria for autism on the ADI-R and ADOS evaluation scales (this inclusion criteria will be explained during the consent process).||They meet non of the Exclusionary criteria, which include:||Known genetic disorder|Hearing or gross sensorimotor deficits|Clinical evidence of progressive encephalopathy|Asphyxia at birth or any other time|Frequent seizures or use of anticonvulsant drugs or psychotropic medication|Known presence of focal brain lesions, brain atrophy or ventriculomegaly. Children will be considered for the control group if the child meets all of the above criteria except they do not meet the criteria for autism or close to it on the ADOS and ADI-R evaluation scales.||Methods:||The child will be seated in a comfortable chair and the physiological assessment will begin after a head circumference is obtained with a tape measure, an EEG cap is placed on the child's head and gel is applied to each electrode in the cap. The tasks include 5 minutes of baseline EEG recording while the child is looking at a design on a monitor placed 2 meters in front of the chair. We then will proceed with a series of auditory and visual stimuli presented by computer through two speakers placed 1 meter in front of the child (auditory) and strobe (visual) at 50 cm. The paradigms will include a presentation of pairs of tones with variable interstimulus intervals presented in random order at 65 dB SPL, a paradigm with either 1000 Hz or 800 Hz at 65 dB, and a final auditory paradigm with two different phonemes, presented at 65 dB. The visual tasks will involve the presentation of flashes of light which vary in frequency and luminance both reflected off a white board one meter from the child and directly at the child's visual field. In each series, there will be a 1 minute break between two blocks of 100 trials each for a total of 200 trials. The experimenter will show the child an interesting toy and talk to the child during the break.||The parent will be asked to complete the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales (CSBS) and the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory. In the case that the subjects are recruited from the Ladders infant sib study, we will use the existing ADI-R and ADOS data because Ladders has authorized the release of this information.||The total time for the laboratory session will be approximately 1 hour. The full battery of tasks will be performed on compliant children. For those children whose attention cannot be maintained for the full battery, the examiner will stop and give breaks as needed. The examiner will go on to the next task or terminate the session if the subject or parent of the subject chooses to do so., autism|pervasive developmental disorder|evoked potentials|EEG|Coherence",1
"Effects of Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy on Adaptive, Aberrant and Stereotyped Behaviors in Children With Autism, Positive treatment effects of HBOT have been reported in a number of studies, while others have found no demonstrable effect. Studies to date have evaluated effects on a variety of conditions, and utilized diverse research methods and generally await replication. Despite its increasing usage in children with autism, and the preliminary anecdotal reports indicating positive outcome, there is a paucity of well-controlled studies of HBOT in this population, which precludes clinicians from recommending and/or implementing it as an evidence-based treatment. It is clearly important therefore, to evaluate carefully the treatment effects of HBOT using robust research designs in this population.||Hypotheses||Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy will be associated with a positive effect on symptoms of autism.|Treatment gains obtained from Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy will be maintained at follow-up.||Specific Aims||Evaluate the effects of Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy on behavioral and cognitive symptoms of autism before, during, and after treatment.|Determine the percentage of children with autism who respond positively to 80 HBOT treatment cycles and the extent to which they do so.|Determine the extent to which any observed treatment effects are maintained up to three months after HBOT.||Study duration: Two weeks baseline, 10-15 week acute phase, with 1- and 3-month follow-ups.||All participants will spend one hour per session in hyperbaric oxygen chambers, for a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 10 sessions per week.

"Docosahexaenoic Acid in the Treatment of Autism, Autism is a neurodevelopmental disability with an increasing prevalence. Traditional medicine does not offer any cures for autism; thus, many parents of children with autism are attracted to complementary and alternative therapies, one of which is dietary supplementation with the long chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA is a critical structural lipid of brain cell membranes and differences in brain DHA content may influence synaptic function, particularly in nutritionally-sensitive areas of the brain, such as the cerebellum and hippocampus, which may be brain structures involved in the etiology of autism. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating whether DHA supplementation is an effective treatment for children with autism. Eighty children with autism will be randomized to receive 200mg of DHA or placebo for 6 months. Outcome variables will include total plasma fatty acid patterns and scores on parent and investigator-completed behavioral and developmental rating scales at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of supplementation. Differences between groups after 6 months will be evaluated using regression methods. Regression analysis will be used to detect correlations between plasma total fatty acid DHA contents and scores on the various outcome measures. Results from this study will either provide evidence for a breakthrough biomedical treatment alternative for children with autism or evidenced-based advice to desperate parents in regard to their choices of potential treatments for their children with autism, autism|omega-3 fatty acids|docosahexaenoic acid",1

Elevated prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction in individuals with ASD suggested that targeting gut may benefit patients with ASD. Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 (PS128) was reported to be a psychobiotic in several animal studies which modulated the levels of neurotransmitters in different brain areas.

"Improving Working Memory of Children With Autism, Prescreening:||The purpose of prescreening is to determine the IQ and functioning level of the participants. The investigators will administrate IQ tests in which the participants will complete a series of tasks such as pointing to images/objects, placing objects, and answer questions upon instruction. The investigators will interview parents regarding their children's levels of functioning as well as their information (e.g., level of education). Additionally, the investigators will also assess the number of digits (digit span) and delay for each participant as the participants may function at different levels. Members of the research team will test a combination of different digit span and delays for each participant to assess how many digits in a sequence (i.e., digit span) they can remember and how long (i.e., delay) they can remember the digit sequence.||Pretest:||A pretest trial starts when a teacher asks a participant to repeat a sequence of numbers and a sequence of nonsense words. The teacher will say one number or one nonsense word at a time, wait for a predetermined interval, and ask the participant to report the numbers or the words in the exact sequence as they hear. The trial ends after the participant recalls correctly or incorrectly, or if the participant does not produce a recall after 5 s. The teacher will not provide any verbal feedback for participants' responses during the pretest. The investigators will conduct pretest for approximately one week. During the pretest, teacher will record exactly what the participant says.||Random assignment:||After pretest, the participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: control, rehearsal, reinforcement, and rehearsal + reinforcement groups.||Control group Participants in this group will not receive any intervention during the study.||Rehearsal group Participants in this group will receive rehearsal intervention. The intervention will last approximately 2-3 weeks depending on the participant performance. Sessions will be conducted daily, and each will include 10 trials.||A preference assessment will be conducted to determine the reinforcer before each session. Participants will be asked to choose a reinforcer that they would like to receive during the instruction. In a rehearsal trial, the teacher will verbally present numbers in a sequence. After a number is verbally presented, the teacher will prompt the participant to rehearse (repeat) the number being said as well as all previous numbers. Correct rehearsal will be followed by a reinforcer (e.g., an edible item with verbal praise). Once the participant can independently rehearse the number(s), the prompts for verbal rehearsal will only be provided when he or she does not start providing a rehearsal within 1 s. The reinforcer will then only be given for correct unprompted verbal rehearsal. If the participant does not provide any verbal rehearsals or verbalize incorrect numbers, the instructor will repeat the process and ask the participant to rehearse the numbers again. After the predetermined delay after the correct verbal rehearsal, the participant will be asked to recall the number sequence. No reinforcement or feedback will be provided.||Reinforcement group A preference assessment will be conducted to determine the reinforcer before each session. Participants will be asked to choose a reinforcer that they would like to receive during the instruction. Before each trial, the teacher will verbally instruct the participant to try to remember the numbers and that the reinforcer will be delivered upon the correct recall. In each trial, the teacher will verbally present numbers in a sequence. After a while, the teacher will ask the participant to repeat the numbers in the sequence. If the participant correctly repeats the numbers, the reinforcer will be given. If the numbers are repeated incorrectly, the reinforcement will not be given. No other instruction will be given (e.g., on rehearsal strategy).||Rehearsal + reinforcement group The participants in this group will receive rehearsal intervention and reinforcement in the same manner as the participants in the rehearsal group as well as in the reinforcement group.||Posttest:||Posttest procedure and data collection will be the same as those during pretest., 0",1

"Ziprasidone in Children With Autism: A Pilot Study, I. SPECIFIC AIMS||To investigate the safety of clinical use of ziprasidone in children|To investigate the dosages that have been employed clinically.||II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE||Ziprasidone, a recently released atypical agent is likely to be as effective as other neuroleptics in treating psychiatric symptoms in children, but may have the considerable health advantage of not causing weight gain. Ziprasidone administration has been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval (mean=20 msec), an electrocardiographic measure of ventricular repolarization (Federal Drug Administration, 2000). There are no reports regarding the use of ziprasidone in autism, and data regarding the safety and efficacy of ziprasidone in children is extremely limited. The only published study of ziprasidone in children found that it was safe and effective in treating Tourette's syndrome in children aged 7 to 17 years of age (Sallee et al, 2000). Because children are being treated with ziprasidone despite a paucity of safety data, it is important to begin to collect and review available data, including that from clinical usage. Some children who receive services within the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Services of Drexel University College of Medicine have been treated with ziprasidone. The charts of the children and adolescents will contain data regarding exposure to ziprasidone and laboratory data and ECG's that can be reviewed to determine whether ziprasidone treatment has been associated with changes in weight, laboratory values and ECG's. We propose to review the charts of patients who have been treated with our services since March 1, 2001 XXX because such patients may have been exposed to ziprasidone (ziprasidone received FDA approval on February 5, 2001).||III. DESIGN AND METHODS||A. Setting: The setting for this study will be the Specialty Clinic for Pervasive Developmental Disorders, part of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic at Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute.||B. Subjects: Subjects will be 15 children and adolescents who meet the DSM-IV Criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorder.||C. Design: This is a 6-week pilot study employing open treatment with ziprasidone. Subjects will be rated at baseline and thereafter assessed weekly.||D. Medication: Subjects will be treated openly with ziprasidone. Should untoward effects occur, the dosage of the medication will be reduced or the medication will be discontinued, as clinically appropriate. Subjects will not receive other concomitant psychotropic medication during the study. Medication will be taken concomitant with food.||Ziprasidone Dosing Strategy: Ziprasidone tablets (5, 10, and 20 mg) will be employed for the study. The dosage range for ziprasidone will be 5 mg/day to 40 mg/day. Every effort will be made to reach and maintain a therapeutic dosage by week four of the treatment phase.||For subjects who weigh less than 25 kg, starting dosage will be 5 mg/every other day. After 3 days, the dosage can be increased to 5 mg. By week 2, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 20 mg increments weekly.|For subjects who weigh greater than 25 kg, the starting dosage will be 5 mg/day. After three days, the dosage can be increased to 10 mg/day. By week two, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 20 mg increments weekly as needed.||Note: Should 5 mg tablets not be available, the dosing schedule will be altered to have a starting dosage of 10 mg, and dosage increases will be made in 10 mg increments.||F. Measures||Primary efficacy measure: The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI; Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The efficacy of treatments can be judged on their ability to enhance global functioning, an assessment that is particularly relative in a pilot study. The CGI consists of three global scales measuring severity of illness, global improvement, and drug effect, and has been useful in measuring drug treatment effect in this population (see Campbell and Palij, 1985). The PI and another trained rater will complete this scale. Although only members of the research team generally complete this scale, it will additionally be completed by the subject's parent/caretaker. Having it completed by the parent/caretaker will take only minutes and may result in useful data. This measure will be completed weekly beginning at baseline.|Secondary efficacy measure: Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The CPRS was developed by the Psychopharmacology Branch of the NIMH to rate childhood psychopathology. Each of the items is rated from ""1"" (not present) to ""7"" (extremely severe). The first 28 items of this scale require no verbal response on the part of the subject, making them appropriate for rating children and adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Of these 28 items, 14 are particularly relevant in autism (see Campbell and Palij, 1985): they assess the symptoms for which drug treatment is indicated including hyperactivity, aggression, self-abusive behavior, temper tantrums, lability of mood, irritability, social withdrawal, and stereotypies. A composite sum of these 14 items, the CPRS-14, will be constructed and employed as a secondary outcome measure, a procedure used by a number of investigators (Anderson et al, 1989; Campbell et al, 1986, 1989, 1993; Findling et al, 1997; Sanchez et al, 1996). We analyzed our data using the CPRS-14; the ICC was 0.8978. In addition, 4 factors derived from these 14 items will be examined. They include: autism, anger/uncooperativeness, hyperactivity, and speech deviance (Overall and Campbell, 1988). This measure will be completed at baseline and at the end of treatment.|Safety measures: (1) A physical exam will be completed at baseline. (2) Height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse will be obtained and recorded at baseline and at each visit during the study. (3) The following laboratory measures will be obtained at baseline and repeated at the end of the treatment phase: complete blood count with differential, liver functions, and electrocardiogram. Serum prolactin will be obtained at baseline and at the end of the treatment phase. These laboratory studies will be repeated at the end of the treatment phase of the study. Any other clinically appropriate tests and evaluations will also be completed whenever needed.||Untoward effects will be measured and recorded at each visit employing the following measures: (1) Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (DOTES); (2) Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS); (3) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (all from Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985); and (4) the Neurologic Rating Scale (Simpson and Angus, 1970). The DOTES and TESS measure a wide range of possible untoward effects. The AIMS measures dyskinesias. The Neurologic Rating Scale measures other forms of extrapyramidal effects that can occur with neuroleptics such as dystonias, parkinsonian effects, and akathisia.||G. Procedures: All patients appropriate to the study and their parent/caretakers will be approached and informed consent and assent (in subjects under 14 years) will be obtained. Subjects meeting the Inclusion Criteria, but not the Exclusion Criteria, will enter the baseline period of the study.||Baseline (week 0): Subjects will be rated at baseline employing the CGI and the CPRS.||End of Treatment (week 6): At the end of the treatment period, subjects will again be rated employing the CGI and the CPRS (selected items).||In addition, each subject will be rated on the CGI at each visit so that data from the last visit is available should the subject terminate the study prematurely. If it is known that a subject will terminate the study at a visit before week 6, the subject will be rated with the CGI and the CPRS at that visit.||All safety measures will be completed at each visit. Laboratory measures and EKG will be obtained in the morning.||I. Analysis: This is a pilot study whose purpose is to get initial safety and efficacy data with ziprasidone in children with autism. We will perform an ANOVA, repeated measures, for CGI severity scores, the CPRS-14 and the CPRS factors.

"Divalproex Sodium ER in Adult Autism, Based on positive research with divalproex in children/adolescents with autism, we would like to extend this research to autistic adults with high levels of aggression, irritability, affective instability, or agitation. We aim to have 10 adult autistic patients enrolled in our study of the treatment of aggression/irritability with divalproex sodium ER. This will be an open treatment for adult patients to determine if the tolerability of divalproex sodium is better with the extended release. We propose this open label design because previous double-blinded studies of divalproex sodium were only done in children, not adults. These results will serve as pilot data for a future blinded study for autistic adults with the extended release formulation. This naturalistic design will allow for prior stable (3 months) use of concomitant medications. Our objective is to determine how well these patients can tolerate the prescribed doses and what added benefits can be attributed to divalproex sodium ER., autism|divalproex sodium ER|aggression|irritability",1
"A Study of Oxytocin in Children and Adolescents With Autistic Disorder, The proposed pilot study is an essential first step toward rigorously evaluating oxytocin treatment of individuals with autism. The biologic actions of oxytocin on social cognition and prosocial behaviors and the clinical, genetic and epigenetic evidence for involvement of the oxytocin system in the pathophysiology of some cases of autism strongly suggest that supplemental oxytocin therapy could significantly improve the social disabilities involved in autism. Many people feel that these social difficulties are the most characteristic and central feature of autism. Overall, this study aims to determine the tolerability, accessibility, and feasibility of an oxytocin pilot study.||This study will consent up to 30 subjects in order to randomize up to 25 subjects into a 2-month (8 weeks) randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled initial treatment period, a subsequent 2-month (8 weeks) period in which all participants receive oxytocin, and up to three post-treatment visits that occur at week 28 (±2 weeks),an interim visit anytime between week 16 and week 76 only for those patients who plan to start oxytocin on their own outside of study treatment and who will experience a lag time between week 16 (end of open label treatment) and when outside oxytocin treatment will begin, and some time before week 76. The investigators hope that this study will help to inform future study designs in determining whether a short term or long term treatment trial is necessary to observe significant effects. This will also help to develop systematic preliminary safety measures., 0",1
"The Effect of Parenting With Positive Behavior Interventions on Community Inclusion for Military Connected and Dependent Children With Autism and Their Parents, Participants will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to either immediately receive the Parenting with Positive Behavior Interventions or you will be asked to wait in a control condition for six months and then receive the same intervention. Participants have an equal chance of being assigned to any one of the groups (get the treatment immediately or wait 6 months) but will be given a chance to receive the intervention regardless within 6 months.||In this study, participants will be asked to do the following things:||Attend (virtually or in-person) a one-hour monthly training about behavior interventions for children with autism.|Participate in two 60- minutes sessions with a behavior coach (virtually or in-person) each month to talk about a community goal they want to complete with their child.|Attend an optional 60-minute meeting with other research participates each month to talk about their experience learning how to manage their child's behavior.|Work with a researcher to fill out a series of questionnaires 3 times during the study. These questionnaires will ask about participants, their child's challenging behaviors, stress related to community activities with their child, and how often they participate in community activities with their child with autism and challenging behavior., 0",1
"Use of Functional Behavioral Assessments to Evaluate Stereotypy and Repetitive Behaviors in a Double-blind, Placebo Controlled Trials of Various Medications Used to Treat Children With Autism., Research geared towards increasing knowledge of the variables contributing to treatment response is critical to advancing intervention studies in ASD. Literature in the growing field of clinical behavioral pharmacology suggests functional behavioral assessments (FBA), when integrated into clinical trials of medication, can be important tools in elucidating the specificity of treatment effects (Mace & Mauk, 1995, Northup & Gully, 2001). The goal of this study is to evaluate the use of clinical behavioral pharmacology methods, primarily descriptive functional behavioral assessments (FBA), in a double-masked, placebo controlled trial of medications used to treat children with autism. These medications are hypothesized to reduce the stereotyped and repetitive behaviors in ASD. This study will focus on the use of descriptive FBAs in distinguishing responders vs. non-responders on the basis of behavior function, in evaluating functional patterns for stereotypy, and in using descriptive FBAs as outcome measures in clinical trials.||This study is accordance with CAN research priorities in its focus on improving methodological approaches in clinical trials (Hollander, et al., 2004). This study is also consistent with recent NIMH recommendations for clinical research. The recommendations identify the integration of behavioral research methods with traditional methods of clinical research (i.e. group designs) as important aims for ASD treatment research (CPEA/STAART working group, 2004). As such, this study fills significant gaps in two research areas: treatments for repetitive behaviors and research methodology in treatment trials for individuals with ASD.||The bio-behavioral methods proposed for use in this evaluation have been previously used to stratify and match treatments for self-injurious behavior in adults with developmental disabilities (Mace & Mauk, 1995), identify specific treatment effects of methylphenidate in children with ADHD (Northup & Gully, 2001), and more recently in evaluating the specificity of risperidone's effects on destructive behaviors in individuals with autism (Crosland, et al, 2003).||Despite that stereotyped and repetitive behaviors are a core symptom domain of ASD, behavioral pharmacology approaches to date have only evaluated the correlated symptoms of aggression, self-injurious, and destructive behaviors in ASD. Repetitive behaviors in ASD include stereotypic movements, repetition of routine behaviors, repetitive play, perseverative speech, and over-focus on restricted interests. These repetitive movements may be associated with emotional distress, tension, or dysphoria and have significant impacts on daily life. It is believed that the methods used to elucidate and specify treatment effects in other medications and disorders will also be valuable to the understanding of SSRI effects in autism.||Both behavioral and pharmacological treatments have been used to treat repetitive and stereotyped behaviors in autism. Behavioral treatments include the use of noncontingent reinforcement (Britton, et al., 2002) and alternative response training to maintain homeostasis (Johnson, Laarhoven, & Repp, 2002). Psychopharmacological approaches include the use of SSRIs given the similarity between repetitive behaviors in autism and OCD (McDougle, 1995) and evidence for serotonin dysfunction in ASD (Hollander, 2000). To date, there are few controlled studies with any of the SSRIs in pediatric populations with ASD. Hollander & colleagues (Hollander, et al., in press) at Mt. Sinai recently completed a study suggesting the efficacy of low-dose liquid fluoxetine on reducing repetitive behaviors in a double-blind, placebo controlled crossover study of 45 children with ASD. This proposed FBA evaluation would occur within another SSRI trial at Mt. Sinai, which aims to extend previous findings in a large scale, multisite investigation of the safety and efficacy of liquid citalopram in children with ASD.||Behavioral pharmacology methods Functional behavioral assessments (FBA) are the cornerstone of clinical behavioral pharmacology approaches. The goals of FBAs are to hypothesize and experimentally test the functions of maladaptive behaviors. Within the field of behavior analysis, determining the function of the maladaptive behavior is primary to developing effective interventions.||FBAs involve both experimental and descriptive assessments of behavior functions. Experimental methods, also known as functional analyses (Iwata, et al., 1982/1994), have the advantage of using experimental manipulations and direct, continuous observations of behavior. The procedures outlined by Iwata, et al. (1982/1994) are considered the gold-standard for functional analyses. The procedure involves the use of multi-element, single-subject experimental design. During the functional analysis, consequences presented for a maladaptive behavior are varied. The experimental conditions outlined by Iwata, et al. (1982/1994) are labeled by the presumed function tested in a condition and include: escape/avoidance, attention, automatic reinforcement/self-stimulation, and control (i.e. preferred toys + social attention).||Experimental methods provide valuable and reliable data on behavior functions, but involve significant time and expense for patients and experimenters. In contrast, descriptive methods are based on parent/caregiver-report, direct behavioral observations, and provide information on both consequent and antecedent predictors of behavior. Descriptive methods are strongly correlated with experimental analyses and have advantages because of the information provided on antecedent functions and in their relative cost-effectiveness (Horner, et al., 1997). This study will pilot the use of descriptive assessment methods as an outcome measure and use experimental FBAs to corroborate the results of the descriptive analyses.||The methods and outcome of this investigation will be used to design an independent clinical trial using a multi-method approach, including descriptive and experimental FBAs as outcome measures, in medication studies of repetitive behaviors in ASD. Given this research has limited funding options outside of CAN, funding this project may be a critical, preliminary step in improving our treatment-specificity research and clinical research methods in ASD.||Specific Aims||The primary aim of this study is to determine the usability of functional behavioral assessment (FBA) procedures in predicting and measuring treatment response within a clinical trial of citalopram, an SSRI hypothesized to reduce repetitive behaviors in ASD. The specific aims of the study are as follows:||To predict treatment response through results from descriptive FBAs.|To evaluate functional patterns for stereotypy/repetitive behaviors in ASD.|To evaluate the use of descriptive FBAs as outcome measures in SSRI trials in ASD and to correlate results from descriptive FBAs with standard global rating measures such as the Child Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CYBOCS) and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) for repetitive behaviors and stereotypy., Autism|Functional Behavioral Assessment|Citalopram",1
"Pilot Study of the Effect of Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment on Behavioral and Biomarker Measures in Children With Autism, During the study's 20-week duration, all children will receive Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment (HBOT) for two eight-week sessions, with a four week session between. Therefore, all children will participate in the study for 20 weeks, and will receive HBOT for 16 weeks. This is an open label study. This means that there will not be a placebo group in the study. All study participants will receive the same treatment of HBOT in a hard shell chamber. Normal air contains about 24% oxygen at a pressure of about 1 atmosphere absolute (ATA). The chamber will contain 100 percent oxygen at a pressure of 1.5 ATA, which is equivalent to the pressure at a depth of 15 feet in sea water. Each subject will complete the first 40 treatments during one hour sessions on 5 separate days in each of the first 8 weeks. They will then take a 4-week break before they begin their next 40 treatments, which will also occur during one hour sessions on 5 separate days in each of the last 8 weeks. The entire study will last 20 weeks. The child's behavior will be measured and evaluated at the MIND Institute at the beginning of the study, at week 8, and at week 20., 0",1
"Basic Body Awareness Therapy for Persons With Autism, Introduction Movement quality is a concept that describes how movements are performed in space, time and amount of energy. When the quality is good, the movement is perceived as unrestricted and gives a sense of freedom, physically and mentally. Movement quality and body awareness are dependent on each other. Body awareness is the ability to be consciously present and interpret signals from your own body. A physiotherapeutic treatment method that describes how movement quality and body awareness interact on a deeper level is Basic Body Awareness Therapy (BBAT).||The purpose of BBAT is to raise physical and mental awareness by strengthening the interplay between sensory impressions and motor ability, gaining knowledge of movement patterns and habits that are not functional. Man's ability to perceive, take care of, control and use the body in a functional manner affects the quality and expression of the movements. According to the theory behind BBAT, movement quality and body awareness are both important abilities to develop bodily self-consciousness.||In order to distinguish between oneself and others, ability to gather and make conscious sensory impressions through the body is demanded. In order to understand the impressions and the world around us, one need to be able to integrate sensory impressions to each other into an information with deeper meaning, the creation of perceptual coherence. The perceptual coherence is the basis for knowledge of one's own body and movement quality. Body awareness increases with more experience of movement. based on the physiotherapeutic bodyself, the subjective (""I as my body"") and objective (""I in my body"") identity we use to meet and understand the world. The bodyself comes to expression through the degree of movement quality and can as such be observed.||When people with autism grow up, their development differs from typically developed peers. They may find it difficult to understand that other people have their own thoughts and feelings, so-called theory of mind and to understand their own feelings and inner states. They may lack central coherence, being able to merge details to the whole. They may also react differently to smells, flavors, sounds or materials carried on the body, having difficulty imitating others, have less flexibility to achieve motion targets, have poorer motor skills and/or sensorimotor function. In autism, the ability for multi-sensory integration is often inadequate. In this way, context and meaning can become less comprehensible and meaningful. This can lead to changes in the bodyself.||As children with autism exhibit worse body awareness and movement quality than children with typical development, it may be likely that body and movement experiences are reduced through upbringing. This can affect physical and mental health, as seen in autism. A study from 1991 examined how young adults with autism describe how movement quality from a body function perspective affects their ability to maintain daily activities and participation. The attention it required of the individual to attempt to master stereotyped movements to be considered ""normal"", resulted in increased mental energy utilization as they constantly watched their own behavior, also creating anxiety. In a previous study we interviewed eleven young adults with autism about their experiences about body and movement, as well as examined them with one motor and one body awareness instrument. The results showed conflicting feelings about their bodies and movements, but also how movement quality was related to the way the individual had access to functional strategies to handle everyday situations or not. There is little knowledge about the effects of various interventions that focus on body awareness and movement quality in this group.||The objective of this study is to investigate effects of a BBAT intervention for young adults with autism. Research question: Can an intervention with BBAT help young adults with autism to improve their movement qualities in everyday activities and achieve individually expressed need to improve?||Participants The participants will be young adults with autism, living in the region of Skaraborg in Västra Götaland or in the region of Kronoberg. See 10. Eligibility criteria.||All patients with autism, within the criteria, that has been examined with BAS MQ-E may be eligible for participation in this study. Individual needs for improvement are discussed with each individual. If relevant needs are expressed, which may be encountered with BBAT, and the patient is motivated for intervention, he/she will be included in the study following informed consent. The expressed individual need will be defined in a statement, such as ""I experience muscle tensions"" or ""I can calm myself before bedtime"". The intervention will start within one month after performing BAS MQ-E and administered individually. A control group is used within the patient group. With a significance level of 0.05, a power of 0.8 and a moderate effect, at least 20 participants are calculated for in the intervention and control groups respectively.||Ethics The study is approved by The Regional ethical review board in Gothenburg (Dnr 651-17).||Instruments Numeric rating scale Individually expressed health problem is estimated on an individualized 11-degree numeric rating scale (NRS). See 9. Outcome measures.||BAS MQ-E Movement quality will be examined with Body Awareness Scale Movement Quality and Experience (BAS MQ-E). See 9. Outcome measures.||Methods A pragmatic randomized controlled study, pRCT, will be conducted. Participants are jointly managed for Skaraborg and Kronoberg and randomized to intervention group and control group. The distribution is managed by an independent person. Randomization takes place by using a random generator function at http://gallerit.se/slumptal/, with numbers 1 and 2. All 1 means that the participant is randomized to the intervention group, all 2 to the control group.||Intervention group: The layout is individualized based on the results of BAS MQ-E, all three parts. The individually expressed health problem is estimated on the NRS scale. After assessment, 12 occasions are given with BBAT approximately once a week (3-4 months).||Control group: Treatment as usual for 3-4 months. Individualized NRS estimation and assessment with BAS MQ-E are performed according to flowchart. The participant will then have access to BBAT if they wish.||Data collection BAS MQ-E (1) used in the study has been collected either from a previous validation study or from everyday clinic. BAS MQ-E (2), parts Movement test and Questionnaire, will be performed maximum 1 month after the end of the intervention by an independent examiner. Own rating of the individualized health problem using the VAS will be performed prior to the intervention (1), after 7 occasions of intervention (2) and maximum 2 months after last occasion of intervention at 12 weeks, approximately 20 weeks total (3).||Data analysis The primary outcome measure are the results from the NRS ratings. Further, the scores from BAS MQ-E, parts Movement test and Questionnaire, as secondary outcome measure. ANOVA will be used for statistical analysis of differences for repeated measures prior to, during and after the intervention. The intervention- and control groups will be analyzed to each other for any statistical significant difference using Mann Whitney U test (significance level p<0,05).||Clinical significance of the study Body and movements are often described as problems in persons with autism. But it omits that there are also resources in the body to find strategies for everyday life. By strengthening body functions and enhancing movement quality and body awareness through a body therapy intervention, the person with autism can better understand themselves. Strengthened body functions then provide the basis for the individual's opportunities for development and increased participation in society. Expected results thus follow the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, i.e. to eliminate obstacles for people with disabilities to enjoy their human rights and participation, in full and equal to others., Autism|Movement|Body-mind therapy|Physiotherapy",1

The probands and their siblings will also be assessed for other psychiatric disorders (K-SADS-E); autistic symptom dimensions (SRS, SCQ, CAST, ABC), other behavioral symptoms (CBCL, SNAP-IV), and perinatal/environmental risk factors. The direct tests include intelligence (CPM/SPM, WISC-III, WPPSI-R) and neuropsychological tests (CPT, WCST, CANTAB). The parents will be assessed for DSM-IV psychiatric disorders (ASRI-4) and autistic features (AQ, SRS). The investigators will collect blood samples from all the subjects.

"Secretin for the Treatment of Autism, Autism is a disorder characterized by impairments of social interactions, verbal and nonverbal communication, and preoccupation with unusual activities or interests, particularly stereotyped or repetitive movements. This debilitating disorder is estimated to occur in 2 to 10 of every 10,000 births. A primary focus in pyschopharmacological intervention has been to treat specific associated symptoms, such as hyperactivity, aggressiveness, and temper tantrums; there are few pharmacologic treatments directed toward core autistic symptoms.||Secretin is a gut hormone with binding sites in the brain. Previous research has described three patients with autism who underwent diagnostic endoscopy for gastrointestinal complaints and experienced dramatic improvement in autistic symptoms following the administration of intravenous secretin given as part of endoscopy. Though the results of this single, uncontrolled study have limited interpretive value, many autistic children have been exposed and continue to be exposed to this potential treatment in an uncontrolled manner. This double blind, placebo-controlled trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of secretin for the treatment of autism.||Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: synthetic porcine secretin (sPS), biologically derived porcine secretin (bPS), or placebo. Each participant will be given an initial intravenous dose of 0.1 ml of their assigned treatment at the appropriate dose (0.2 ug for sPS and 1 CU for bPS).

"Aripiprazole in Children With Autism: A Pilot Study, I. SPECIFIC AIM||To obtain pilot data regarding the safety, dosing, and efficacy of open-labeled aripiprazole in children, aged 12 to 18 years, diagnosed with autism. A larger, more controlled trial will be planned for this population if the drug is safe and tends to be efficacious.||II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE||Autism is a serious disorder that first presents in childhood, usually before three years of age (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Though the incidence of autism is low (approximately 3-6 cases per 10,000 live births), the consequences of the disorder are severe. As the term ""pervasive"" implies, the symptoms affect most areas of functioning in the developing child, and the disabilities associated with the disorder tend to persist throughout life. Symptoms of autism include abnormalities in social relatedness including extreme withdrawal; communication including no or little speech; and a sameness or repetitiveness in behaviors and interests. Children diagnosed with autism can have severe problems including hyperactivity, lability of mood, irritability, withdrawal, and stereotypical behavior. Because of these severe problems, treatment of symptomatology often includes pharmacotherapy.||The most studied drug for treating children and adolescents with autism is the typical neuroleptic, haloperidol (Anderson et al, 1989; Anderson et al, 1984; Campbell et al, 1978; and Cohen et al, 1980). The main public health concern regarding the use of haloperidol is the risk of inducing dyskinesias (Campbell et al, 1988, 1997), though the dyskinesias have been reversible.||Evidence also suggests that atypical neuroleptics, such as olanzapine (Horrigan et al, 1997b; Malone et al, 2001; Potenza et al, 1999) and risperidone (Demb, 1996; Findling et al, 1997; Fisman and Steele, 1996; Hardan et al, 1996; Horrigan et al, 1997a; Malone et al, 1999b; McDougle et al, 1997; Nicholson et al, 1998; Perry et al, 1997) are effective. But the weight gain associated with these agents can be a considerable health risk (Pi-Sunyer, 1993; Sjostrom, 1992). For example, olanzapine use has reportedly been associated with increased blood glucose (Fertig et al, 1998; Gatta et al, 1999; Ober et al, 1999; Wirshing et al, 1998; Yazici et al, 1998). Ziprasidone is associated with increases in QTc, including in children (Malone, unpublished data).||Aripiprazole, a recently released atypical agent is likely to be as effective as other neuroleptics in autism, but may have the considerable health advantage of not causing weight gain. However, because there is a lack of safety and efficacy data with aripiprazole in children with autism, an open pilot study of aripiprazole in this population is indicated.||III. DESIGN AND METHODS||A. Setting: The setting for this study will be the Specialty Clinic for Pervasive Developmental Disorders, part of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic of Drexel University College of Medicine located at Friends Hospital.||B. Subjects: Subjects will be 15 children and adolescents who meet the DSM-IV Criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorder.||C. Design: This is a 6-week pilot study employing open treatment with aripiprazole. Subjects will be rated at baseline and thereafter assessed weekly.||D. Medication: Subjects will be treated openly with aripiprazole. Should untoward effects occur, the dosage of the medication will be reduced or the medication will be discontinued, as clinically appropriate. Subjects will not receive other concomitant psychotropic medication during the study. Medication will be taken concomitant with food.||Aripiprazole Dosing Strategy: Aripiprazole tablets (10, 15, 20, and 30 mg) will be employed for the study. The dosage range for aripiprazole will be 5 mg/day to 30 mg/day. Every effort will be made to reach and maintain a therapeutic dosage by week four of the treatment phase.||For subjects who weigh less than 25 kg, starting dosage will be 5 mg/every other day. After 3 days, the dosage can be increased to 5 mg. By week 2, subjects can be increased up to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 10 mg increments weekly.|For subjects who weigh greater than 25 kg, the starting dosage will be 5 mg/day. After three days, the dosage can be increased to 10 mg/day. By week two, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 10 mg increments weekly as needed.||Note: Should 5 mg tablets not be available, the dosing schedule will employ ½ of a 10 mg tablet and dosage increases will be made in 10 mg increments. We are starting at a 5 mg dosage to avert excessive sedation at onset of drug administration.||F. Measures||Primary efficacy measure: The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI; Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The efficacy of treatments can be judged on their ability to enhance global functioning, an assessment that is particularly relative in a pilot study. The CGI consists of three global scales measuring severity of illness, global improvement, and drug effect, and has been useful in measuring drug treatment effect in this population (see Campbell and Palij, 1985). The PI and another trained rater will complete this scale. Although only members of the research team generally complete this scale, it will additionally be completed by the subject's parent/caretaker. Having it completed by the parent/caretaker will take only minutes and may result in useful data. This measure will be completed weekly beginning at baseline.|Secondary efficacy measure: Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The CPRS was developed by the Psychopharmacology Branch of the NIMH to rate childhood psychopathology. Each of the items is rated from ""1"" (not present) to ""7"" (extremely severe). The first 28 items of this scale require no verbal response on the part of the subject, making them appropriate for rating children and adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Of these 28 items, 14 are particularly relevant in autism (see Campbell and Palij, 1985): they assess the symptoms for which drug treatment is indicated including hyperactivity, aggression, self-abusive behavior, temper tantrums, lability of mood, irritability, social withdrawal, and stereotypies. A composite sum of these 14 items, the CPRS-14, will be constructed and employed as a secondary outcome measure, a procedure used by a number of investigators (Anderson et al, 1989; Campbell et al, 1986, 1989, 1993; Findling et al, 1997; Sanchez et al, 1996). We analyzed our data using the CPRS-14; the ICC was 0.8978. In addition, 4 factors derived from these 14 items will be examined. They include: autism, anger/uncooperativeness, hyperactivity, and speech deviance (Overall and Campbell, 1988). This measure will be completed at baseline and at the end of treatment.|Safety measures: (1) A physical exam will be completed at baseline. (2) Height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse will be obtained and recorded at baseline and at each visit during the study. (3) The following laboratory measures will be obtained at baseline and repeated at the end of the treatment phase: complete blood count with differential, liver functions, and electrocardiogram. Serum prolactin will be obtained at baseline and at the end of the treatment phase. Any other clinically appropriate tests and evaluations will also be completed whenever needed.||Untoward effects will be measured and recorded at each visit employing the following measures: (1) Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (DOTES); (2) Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS); (3) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (all from Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985); and (4) the Neurologic Rating Scale (Simpson and Angus, 1970). The DOTES and TESS measure a wide range of possible untoward effects. The AIMS measures dyskinesias. The Neurologic Rating Scale measures other forms of extrapyramidal effects that can occur with neuroleptics such as dystonias, parkinsonian effects, and akathisia.||G. Procedures: All patients appropriate to the study and their parent/caretakers will be approached and informed consent and assent (in subjects under 14 years) will be obtained. Subjects meeting the Inclusion Criteria, but not the Exclusion Criteria, will enter the baseline period of the study.||Baseline (week 0): Subjects will be rated at baseline employing the CGI and the CPRS.||End of Treatment (week 6): At the end of the treatment period, subjects will again be rated employing the CGI and the CPRS (selected items).||In addition, each subject will be rated on the CGI at each visit so that data from the last visit is available should the subject terminate the study prematurely. If it is known that a subject will terminate the study at a visit before week 6, the subject will be rated with the CGI and the CPRS at that visit.||All safety measures will be completed at each visit. Laboratory measures and EKG will be obtained in the morning.||H. Analysis: This is a pilot study whose purpose is to get initial safety and efficacy data with aripiprazole in children with autism.

"Joint Attention Intervention and Young Children With Autism, Young children with autism experience severe deficit in joint attention skills (e.g. pointing to objects, showing, following another person's gaze, responding to invitations to social interaction). Ability to initiate and respond to joint attention is linked to children's later language abilities. As a mean to improve language outcome in children with autism, it is important to target joint attention in early intervention programs.||This study investigates the effectiveness of a joint attention intervention. Sixty 2-4 year old children with autism will be randomized to an intervention group or a control group. Children in both groups will continue their ordinary preschool program. However, the children in the intervention group will also participate in 80 joint attention intervention sessions. The sessions (20 minutes each) will be conducted twice a day for 8 weeks by preschool teachers or paraprofessionals working in the preschools. Before starting the intervention preschool teachers and paraprofessionals will be taught how to teach joint attention skills and how to initiate and maintain episodes of joint engagement. During the course of intervention they will be supervised by trained counselors.||Outcome measures will include joint attention skills, language skills and joint engagement. Children will be assessed at baseline, after 10 weeks and at follow up 6 months and 1 year after the end of the intervention. The measures are based on direct testing of the children, video observations and questionnaires to parent and professionals., autism|joint attention|intervention|joint engagement|language",1
"Clinical and Genetic Study of Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autism is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder with prominent reciprocal social and communication impairment and restricted repetitive behavior or interest. Based on the number of symptoms and functional impairment, autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, and atypical autism (or PDDNOS) are conceptualized as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most recent survey estimated the prevalence of narrow diagnosis of autistic disorder to be around 0.1% to 0.2%, and 0.59 % to 0.63% for ASD, with a four-fold male predominance. Due to high heritability (> 0.9), high family recurrence risk (λ = 60), and severe impairment without effective prevention and treatment available for ASD, this disastrous disease has been prioritized for molecular genetic study from public health perspective. The proposed research is the first systematic approach combining clinical and molecular genetic study of ASD involving multi-sites and three research cores: assessment core (by Gau SS and Wu YY), molecular genetics core (by Chen CH), and data/statistics core (by Gau SS).||The long-term objective of this study is to establish clinical and genetic database of autism and their family for etiology study, exploration of pathogenesis, and developing new treatment. The specific aims are:||to establish the psychometric properties of three Chinese versions of rating scales for ASD: SCQ, SRS, and ABC;|to collect clinical, neuropsychological, and genetic data of ASD probands and their family and|to identify the genetic variants close to etiological genes of ASD in a Taiwanese sample using candidate gene case-control association study design (e.g., Neuroligin gene family, MeCP2 gene, and FOXP2 gene, parent trio and population-based studies) and whole genome linkage analysis for multiplex families.||After well-preparation of instruments, DNA collection procedure, and assessor's training in the first 6 months, we will recruit 40, 170, and 90 ASD families in the first, second, and third year of the project, respectively. The instruments include the ADI-R, ADOS, K-SADS-E, SCQ, SRS, and ABC for measuring autistic psychopathology; WISC-III, MSEL and PPVT for cognitive ability; CPT, CANTAB, and WCST for neuropsychological functioning, and MRI, MRS, and DSI for brain imaging study.||We anticipate the establishment of the database of 300 ASD families, completion of the mutation screening of several candidate genes, and determination of their association with ASD and its intermediate phenotype in our sample. The identification of susceptible genes for ASD would be a major breakthrough in child psychiatry because this revelation would facilitate the scientific diagnosis of autism and as a result, it would shed light on the pathogenesis of autism and contribute to the development of the novel, specific and effective treatment of this devastating disease., autism spectrum disorder|family genetic study|gene|phenotype|endophenotype",1

"Trichuris Suis Ova in Autism Spectrum Disorders, Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder affecting social, communicative, and compulsive/repetitive behaviors. It is also frequently accompanied by aggression, self-injury, and irritability, making care for these individuals a significant challenge for families or institutional settings. Currently risperidone is the only medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for irritability associated with autism, although not all patients respond to risperidone or are able to tolerate its side effects. As such, additional targeted treatments need to be explored in autism. Neuroimmune disturbance has been demonstrated in patients with autism (Ashwood et al., 2006; DelGuidice, 2003) and the presence of neuroinflammation may play a role in initiating or maintaining CNS dysfunction characteristic of the disorder (Pardo et al, 2005). Therefore, there is considerable interest in using immunomodulatory medications to address core and associated symptoms.||Trichuris suis ova (TSO) are the eggs of intestinal helminthes which induce Th2 cytokine release and nonspecifically downregulate Th1 responsiveness (Summers et al., 2003). Treatment with TSO has been shown to have a beneficial effect in autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease (Summers et al, 2003; Summers et al., 2005a; Summers et al., 2005b) and anecdotal reports from patients with autism have demonstrated that TSO may be effective in reducing repetitive behaviors, aggression, self-injury, and impulsivity.||To date, many medications have been used in individuals with autism and the history of psychopharmacology of autism is notable for the exaggerated benefit of a variety of treatments. To date, most medication studies in the field have been open-label without use of a placebo control and without systematic behavioral assessments. The current practice of prescribing medications to patients with autism without scientifically demonstrated efficacy underscores the necessity for methodologically rigorous studies to be conducted.||We propose a double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial of TSO, where subjects would be randomized to receive placebo or TSO for 12 weeks, with a 4 week washout and then 12 weeks of the the treatment not yet received. To assess the effect on social cognition, repetitive behaviors, aggression and irritability, and global functioning in adults with autism spectrum disorder. The objectives of the proposed study are to develop an innovative treatment approach to autism by 1) assessing the safety and efficacy of TSO treatment using behavioral and laboratory outcome measures; 2) determining whether this treatment has sufficient promise to warrant consideration of a larger, multi-centered, placebo-controlled clinical trial; 3) conducting secondary analyses to explore the relationship between clinical features, immune mechanisms, and treatment response., Autism, Autism Spectrum Disorder|ASD|Trichuris Suis Ova|TSO|Treatment|Clinical Trial",1

"Testing a Novel Speech Intervention in Minimally Verbal Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), The ability to communicate verbally is considered the most important prognostic indicator for children with ASD. If a child has not developed speech by age 5, it is generally considered unlikely that he or she will do so. Although a small number of cases of speech development in older children with ASD have been reported, the type and intensity of treatments used varied widely, suggesting little consensus regarding the likely mechanisms involved. A few preliminary studies have tested the efficacy of interventions that employed techniques such as orienting cues, behavioral strategies, and prompts for facilitating speech acquisition in minimally verbal children, though almost all tested their approaches in children under the age of 5 who would be classified as preverbal rather than minimally verbal.||Principal Investigator Gottfried Schlaug, MD, PhD oversees all aspects of study treatments for the interventional arm of this Autism Center of Excellence directed by Helen Tager-Flusberg of Boston University. The Intervention study's main objective is to compare the effectiveness of one novel treatment for minimally verbal children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), Auditory-Motor Mapping Training (AMMT) to a control intervention termed Speech Repetition Therapy (SRT), both of which were developed and piloted in Dr. Schlaug's laboratory. The aim of the present study is to test whether one of those treatments is more effective than the other in a group of 5;5 to 12;0 year olds.||Participants will be screened and undergo several tests at Boston University's (BU) Autism Center of Excellence. Those found eligible for the intervention ""Testing a novel speech intervention in minimally verbal children with ASD"" will be enrolled and undergo testing at BU, participate in MRI scanning at Massachusetts General Hospital's (MGH) Martinos Imaging Center, and will then be randomly assigned to either the AMMT or SRT group for treatment at BIDMC. Before the intervention begins, participants will have up to 5 Baseline testing sessions (approx. 45-60 min./session) to (1) determine their ability to repeat a set of high-frequency 2-syllable words/phrases (e.g., Hello and All done), and (2) obtain an inventory of speech sounds that they are able to produce prior to treatment.||The intervention consists of 25 one-on-one therapy sessions during which children will be working toward producing (or approximating) a set of high-frequency 2-syllable words/phrases (e.g., ""More, please"", ""Mommy"", ""All done"", etc.). Progress will be monitored several times during the treatment phase as well as immediately after the 25 sessions and 4-weeks later. The total time commitment for the Intervention portion of the study will be approximately 6-8 weeks (i.e., approx. 1 week (±) for Baseline testing; approx. 5 weeks (5 sessions/week) for treatment; and approx. 1 week (±) for several mid- and post-treatment testing sessions). Upon completion of the intervention at BIDMC, participants will undergo post-treatment testing at BU and follow-up MRI at MGH's Martinos Imaging Center.||Results of this study will not only help determine if one of the two interventions is effective by comparing post-treatment assessments to baseline assessments but will also compare the experimental treatment (AMMT) versus the control treatment (SRT) to examine whether or not one is more effective than the other., minimally-verbal|children|intervention|singing|music",1
"SynapDx Autism Gene Expression Analysis Study (STORY), The primary aim of this study is to define a gene expression signature indicative of ASD and to establish its clinical sensitivity and specificity. Clinician diagnosis of ASD will be made using DSM-5 as the reference standard instrument. The widely used diagnostic instrument Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) is a typical component of the clinical assessment for a child diagnosed with ASD and this evaluation will be performed on all study participants. Secondary aims of this study are (1) to define metabolite and lipid signatures indicative of ASD and establish their clinical sensitivity and specificity and (2) to determine clinical sensitivity and specificity of various combinations of gene expression signature, metabolite and/or lipid signatures, and presence of ASD-associated genetic variation detected by CMA and sequencing protein-coding regions of the genome||Analyses: Details of the analysis will be specified in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will include procedures for handling outliers, missing data, and differences across sites. The SAP will be reviewed and approved by a committee of Principal Investigators (PIs) before unblinding of the validation set.||Primary analyses: The primary outcomes of the study will be the estimates of the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the SDX-002 test to classify subjects according to DSM-5 ASD diagnosis, with associated 95% confidence intervals. Sensitivity and specificity will be assessed on the Validation Phase population based on agreement with the clinical diagnosis of presence or absence of Autism Spectrum Disorder by DSM-5 (published May 2013).||The gene expression signature will be trained on the 500 subject Development Phase set, using 5-fold cross validation over the results of several machine learning algorithms, including partial least squares, support vector machines, and boosted decision trees. The training procedure will generate estimated ROC curves for each method, as well as confidence intervals for the area under the curve (AUC). The final choice of a machine-learning algorithm will be based on AUC, as well as on the estimated performance at the chosen operating point on the ROC curve. The operating point will be chosen to provide high sensitivity at an acceptable specificity.||Secondary analyses: In the majority of patients enrolled to date, consent was obtained for collection of an optional bio-repository sample. The intended analysis of the bio-repository samples has now been established (see also, secondary objectives listed above). The metabolomic and lipomic signatures will be similarly assessed on the subset of the 500 subjects in the Development Phase set who consent to a bio-repository sample. In addition to the gene expression signature, metabolite and/or lipid signatures and DNA analysis will be combined with the gene expression signature in various configurations and the impact of these additional measures on clinical sensitivity and specificity will be evaluated. If these additional metabolomic/lipomic signatures and/or DNA analyses improve test performance, these elements may be included in the SDX-002 assay.||Sensitivity and specificity the final SDX-002 assay will also be assessed among subpopulations using demographic information and the results of developmental testing. There are likely to be few subjects in many of these subpopulations and caution will be used in interpreting the results.

"Primary Care Stepping Stones Triple P for Children With Autism, Research literature exists on best practices for screening and diagnosing children with Autism. However, less is known about how to intervene with the child's parent. Across studies, relative to parents of children without disabilities, parents of children with Autism have reported higher levels of stress and lower levels of parenting competence. Such stress places children at risk for adverse developmental outcomes||The proposed study aims to determine the effectiveness of Primary Care Stepping Stones Triple P (PC-SS Triple P), an empirically supported parent mediated intervention, to improve the behavioral functioning of children newly diagnosed with Autism (aged 2-12 years), increase parental resilience and decrease parental stress.||The specific hypotheses include:||Children whose parents receive PC-SS Triple P will demonstrate significantly greater improvements in their behavioral functioning than children of parents receiving Wait-list Control (WLC) at service closure.|At service closure, parents receiving the PC-SS Triple P intervention will be more resilient and demonstrate lower levels of stress than parents in the Wait-List Control (WLC) condition.|Parenting resilience and levels of parental stress will be positively associated with improvements in child behavior.||Seventy-six parents of children newly diagnosed with Autism will be randomized into one of two conditions: a) PC-SS Triple P (N=38) or b) Wait List Control (WLC; N=38).

"Improving Attention Skills of Children With Autism, Young children with autism show impairment in joint attention. The impairment affects their ability to sustain a shared interest in social interaction and to use specific joint attention skills, such as pointing and showing. The importance of joint attention is underscored by data suggesting these skills are important to later language skills. Targeting joint attention deficits in developmentally young children using familiar caregivers may result in better child language outcomes. This study will teach caregivers how to initiate and maintain episodes of joint engagement with their children.||Participants will be randomized to either the intervention group or to a wait list control group. Each caregiver and child in the intervention group will participate in 24 1-hour sessions, 3 times a week for 8 weeks. In these sessions, caregivers will be taught 10 different modules for teaching joint attention skills to their children. Outcome measures will include language and joint attention skills in the child and caregiver adherence to the intervention protocols.

"Intranasal Oxytocin Treatment for Social Deficits in Children With Autism, In recent years, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has been implicated in a wide range of social behaviors including attachment bonds, emotion recognition, eye gaze to social cues, and memory for social information. Social impairments represent one of the most intractable features of autism, and evidence now suggests that OT biology is dysregulated in individuals with this disorder. The central aim of the research outlined here is to test whether OT administration to children with autism increases their quality and quantity of social interactions and enhances their ability to process emotional and social information. Findings from initial single-dose OT administration studies in teenaged and adult males with autism have shown improvement in some aspects of social functioning, but replication and extension to well-controlled treatment trials with younger male and female subjects is necessary to evaluate effectiveness. We therefore aim to investigate the effect of intranasal OT on social cognition and behavior immediately following a single-dose (24IU) and following a 4-week period of OT (24IU BID) administration in a sample of 50 subjects with autism aged 6 to 12 years. The primary outcome for this study is change in social behavior, as determined by parent ratings on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) after the 4-week treatment period. Secondary outcomes are changes in functioning on laboratory-based measures of social behavior and cognition following single-dose and 4-week OT administration. Research in a small study sample (N=13) also identified treatment responders and non-responders to a single-dose of OT. Thus, we also aim to identify biological and cognitive and behavioral variables (i.e., pretreatment levels of social functioning and pretreatment plasma hormone levels) that may influence treatment response efficacy in our larger study sample. On completion of the 4-week treatment period all subjects will have the option of participating in another 4-week double-blind trial in which they will be switched to the alternate nasal spray to that which they previously received. They will then undergo a fourth and final assessment time-point using the same testing procedures as outlined above on completion of the 4-week dosing. By providing subjects with the option of participating in a second 4-week treatment trial, all subjects will have an opportunity to receive the active oxytocin nasal spray. We also will be able to examine any ongoing effects of oxytocin treatment in the group receiving placebo during the second 4-week administration period. Subjects not willing to take part in the second trial will exit the study and will be referred to their treating physician., 0",1
"Long-Term Olanzapine Treatment in Children With Autism, Autism is a serious childhood disorder that can significantly impair functioning and development. Educational and psychosocial programs are standard treatments for autistic children, but drug therapy is often needed as well. Haloperidol is the drug most commonly prescribed for symptoms of autism. However, long-term administration of haloperidol has been associated with adverse effects such as blurred vision, constipation, and nausea. The investigation of alternative drug treatments is necessary. This study will determine whether the antipsychotic drug olanzapine may be a safe and effective alternative to haloperidol for treating symptoms of autism in children.||This study will last 36 weeks and will comprise 2 phases. In Phase I, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either olanzapine or placebo for 12 weeks. Participants who do not respond to treatment will complete their participation in the study. Participants who respond to their assigned Phase I treatment will continue onto Phase II. All Phase II participants will receive olanzapine daily for 6 months. Self-report scales and checklists will be used to assess participants after each phase; these measures will be completed by participants and their parents., Drug Treatment|Child|Olanzapine",1
"Interventions for Communication in Autism Network, While significant progress has been made toward identifying effective interventions for preschool-age children with autism (National Research Council, 2001), few scientifically rigorous studies have compared active ingredients of these interventions or examined outcomes focused on core deficits. To address these areas of need, this collaborative, multi-site project combines the expertise of investigators experienced in randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), in the study of core deficits in young children with autism, and in data management and analysis of multi-site clinical trials.||The goal of this project is to compare the efficacy of two interventions for improving spoken language and reducing symptoms of autism: (1) Discrete trial training (DTT)--an applied behavior analysis approach emphasizing highly structured teaching of school readiness skills (match-to-sample, imitation, functional play, and receptive and expressive language) and (2) Interpersonal developmental approach (IDA): a visually supported, child-focused, flexible engagement, social communicative engagement approach on joint attention, symbolic play, and the use of conventional symbols within socially valid communicative contexts.||Children will be randomly assigned to DTT or IDA. In each condition, children's ongoing early intervention programs will be augmented with two 30-minute sessions daily of the study intervention (DTT or IDA) conducted by supervised therapists for 4 months, with transition to home therapy for 2 months.||Potential moderators (e.g., initial mental age and language age) and mediators (e.g. parent synchronization of joint attention and changes in parental expectancies) on treatment outcome will also be examined.||The assessment measures will include diagnostic and developmental measures. There are three sets of assessments. The first set of assessments is to determine whether the child is eligible for the study. If the child is eligible, we will complete the next set of assessments, which are completed at three points: (1) prior to entry into the treatment (this is a baseline measurement conducted just before the start of the treatment phase); (2) at exit; and (3) at a 6 month follow-up.

"Parents of Newly Diagnosed Preschool Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder:, Statement of the Research Problem/Purpose/Objectives Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological disorder that causes complex developmental difficulties within the first three years of life. Preschool children diagnosed with ASD typically have pervasive deficits in social interaction and communication, and the occurrence of repetitive and restrictive behaviours. Parenting a preschool child with these characteristics, coupled with the devastating impact of their child receiving a diagnosis of ASD, creates high levels of parental anxiety, stress, depression, and general mental health difficulties. Given the seriousness of the child's diagnosis and the compromise in parenting and family functioning, families are referred to formalized treatment programs that provide support for both the child and parents. However, with the recent rise in Autism prevalence rates Manitoba parents now wait up to a year to receive formalized government funded treatment services for their child and family. This delay in formalized service has critically important consequences for the child, the family, and society.||To bridge this gap in service, parents could be afforded the opportunity to participate in a cost efficient self-directed online training and support program specific to parents in Manitoba. Given that there is consistent evidence to support the effectiveness of parent training and involvement once a child has entered a formalized treatment program, the potential effectiveness of parent training and support while waiting for a formalized treatment program should also be considered.||Research on the efficacy and effectiveness of on-line self-directed Autism parent training programs is extremely limited. Additionally, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the appropriate content, timing, and duration of a training program for parents of newly diagnosed children with ASD and conflicting evidence on the interactional effects between parent training and levels of parenting stress during this time period.||The primary purpose of this study is to address the training and support requirements of parents of preschool children newly diagnosed with ASD, by developing and evaluating the effectiveness of a self-directed on-line ASD parent training and support program. The secondary purpose is to assess the interactional effects, of a self-directed on-line ASD parent training and support program, and parent stress, on parent and child outcomes. It is predicted that if parents receive on-line training and support they will increase their parenting knowledge and skills, reduce their levels of stress, and create better engagement and communication outcomes for their child, in comparison to parents who do not receive the training and support.||Methods: The experimental study will use a randomized, masked, waitlist control design that compares an intervention treatment group to a waitlist control group. After meeting criteria and consent requirements for participation in the study, all families will participate in pre-measures. Families will then be randomized to either a treatment group or a waitlist control group. After pre measures the treatment group parents will receive access to the on-line self-directed training and support program for a 4-month period. After this time period both groups will then be re-assessed on the Parent and Child outcome measures and then the Waitlist Group will be given access to the on-line self-directed training and support program.||Procedure. After a family has been assessed as eligible for the study, and have signed consent forms to participate in the study, they will be given an appointment time to attend the nursery setting for pre-measures. One parent will be asked to engage in free play with their child similar to how they would at home (using a standardized set of toys). The parent will be video recorded playing with their child for a ten-minute period, and then asked to answer the three questionnaires. This procedure will occur at baseline (Time 1, within 2 months of diagnosis), and after the treatment period (Time 2, at least four months after the baseline measure). After base-line measures, families will be randomly assigned to the treatment group, and the waitlist group, using a random numbers table and a pre-arranged opaque envelope system. Treatment group parents will then be given access to participate in the on-line self-directed parent training and support intervention between Time 1 and Time 2, and the waitlist group parents will be given access to the intervention after Time 2. Parents will be given codes to access the on-line resources to ensure their anonymity to other participants. The codes will also allow the principle investigator to track when parents access the on-line training and support and when they have completed the on-line training. When treatment group parents have completed the on-line training (and after at least a four-month period has elapsed since the baseline measure) the parent and child will be invited back to the nursery setting for Time 2 measurements.||Additionally, after a four-month period the matched waitlist group parent and child will be invited back to the original setting for Time 2 measurements, after which they will be given access to the on-line training and support. Families that signed consent forms and then dropped out, will also be given access to the on-line training and support, at this time. The personnel used to administer, score and input the data for the questionnaires, and observational measures, will be masked as to the participant's group assignment and time of measure. All data will contain only the code with no specific participant identifiers. All digital video recordings, questionnaires, observations sheets, and participant code sheets will be kept in a locked cabinet in the office of the main investigator and on a password protected secured government server. Inter-observer agreement will be used in the observation measures of the parent's intervention techniques and the child's measures of engagement and communication. For these observational measures, personnel will be trained by the primary investigator. Inter-observer agreement will be used in a training procedure until personnel meet or exceed 80% agreement on each measure for two consecutive observation trials. Additionally, after all observation data has been collected, a random sample of 20% of the data for each measure will be scored by two personnel, and inter-observer agreement will be reported.||The independent variable is the on-line self-directed parent training and support program. Each on-line module contains multi-media presentations (written material, graphics, and video's), links to additional materials found on the internet, summaries of key information, small quizzes that help parents focus on important material and an accompanying parent workbook. In addition, parents are directed in Module 2 to an on-line parenting support and information sharing forum exclusive to the parents in the training program. Through the on-line forum parents can access a professional autism specialist and other parents involved in the study, and are able to ask questions, answer questions, provide comments, discuss issues, and in general receive support and give support to others.||Four specific hypotheses will be tested for statistical significance. The first hypothesis is: Parents in the treatment group will have significantly higher Family Support, Knowledge and Intervention Techniques scores, and significantly lower Stress scores at Time 2, compared to the control group. This hypothesis will be tested individually for each measure using an Analysis of Covariance design (ANCOVA) to test for differences between groups while adjusting for any initial difference.||The second hypothesis is: Children of parents in the treatment group will have significantly higher scores in Engagement and Communication at Time 2 compared to children of parents in the control group. This hypothesis will be tested individually for each measure using an Analysis of Covariance design (ANCOVA) to test for differences between groups while adjusting for any initial difference.||The third hypothesis is: Parent's perceived level of stress will moderate the treatment effects on Parent outcomes measures of Knowledge and Intervention Techniques at Time 2. Specifically, it is hypothesized that there will be a negative (inverse) correlation between Parent stress scores at Time 1 and Parent Knowledge and Intervention Technique scores at time 2 (the higher the parent's stress score at Time 1, the lower the parent's Knowledge and Intervention Technique scores at Time 2). Additionally, it is hypothesized that there will be a negative (inverse) correlation between the parent's change in stress scores from Time 1 to Time 2 to parent's Knowledge and Intervention Technique scores at Time 2 (as parents perceived level of stress decreases from Time 1 to Time 2 parent's Knowledge and Intervention Technique scores will increase at Time 2).

Specifically, it is hypothesized that there will be a negative (inverse) correlation between Parent stress scores at Time 1 and Child Engagement and Communication scores at time 2 (the higher the parent's stress score at Time 1, the lower the Child Engagement and Communication scores at Time 2). Additionally, it is hypothesized that there will be a negative (inverse) correlation between the parent's change in stress scores from Time 1 to Time 2 to the Child's Engagement and Communication scores at Time 2 (as parents perceived level of stress decreases from Time 1 to Time 2 the Child's Engagement and Communication scores will increase at Time 2). Correlations will be conducted using Pearson's product-moment (r) calculations.||Process for Seeking Consent Initial screening for patients that meet the criteria will be done by the Developmental Pediatricians at the Child Development Clinic. When patients are in the SSCY Centre for a counsel with their Pediatrician, the Pediatrician will provide the families of all those who meet the inclusion criteria with a study advertisement containing the PIs contact information. Parents who phone the Principal Investigator to find out more about their participation in the study will be given the option of meeting the Principal Investigator at an office in the SSCY Centre or at their home, or at a place of their choosing. The Principal Investigator will explain the study and the consent form at that time. Parents will be told that they do not need to decide immediately and that they have the option of reviewing the study documentation and consent forms with others, and at their convenience.

"Parent Language Intervention for Autism, High dosage of early intervention is critical to language skill development in young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and including parents is a cost-effective approach to maximize intervention dosage. However, parent-mediated interventions have inconsistent effects on parent and child outcomes. This variability is likely because parents do not have the same training as clinicians and little effort has been spent examining parent characteristics that may influence their ability to implement different types of intervention strategies. Given the known cognitive, personality and language features present among many parents of children with ASD, examining the relationship between learning styles in parents and their implementation of different parent-mediated intervention strategies is an important first step in identifying potential sources of variability in parent-mediated intervention outcomes. The objective of the proposed study is to examine how parent learning style influences parent use of language intervention strategies and subsequent child language skills. The central hypothesis is that the parent learning style will be associated with: (a) differential use of language intervention strategies and (b) child language skills. The specific aims include determining the extent to which: (a) parent learning style and type of parent-mediated intervention are associated with mother use of language intervention strategies and subsequent child language skills, (b) parent learning style moderates the relationship between intervention type and mother use of language intervention strategies, and (c) parent learning style is associated with their use of language intervention strategies and their children's language skills. The proposed study will enroll 108 children with ASD between 24 and 36 months of age and their mothers. Mother-child dyads will be randomly assigned to one of two parent-mediated intervention strategies that are contrasted in their theoretical approach (responsive-developmental, directive-behavioral). Mother-child dyads will be assessed before randomization (pre-test), after intervention (post-test) and 3 months after the end of intervention to monitor maintenance. Children in both groups will receive 8 weekly intervention sessions at home using the same experimental procedures. The proposed research is significant because it will be the first examination of the impact of parent learning style on both parent and child outcomes of two different parent-mediated intervention strategies (directive, responsive). Understanding the effects of parent learning style on parent use of intervention strategies and subsequent child language skills is a key step in customizing parent-mediated interventions based on parent characteristics. The long-term positive effect of the proposed research is to improve language outcomes of interventions for children with autism by tailoring parent-mediated interventions that capitalize on parental strengths., Language Intervention|Parent-Mediated Intervention",1
"A Controlled Trial of the Clinical Effects of Hyperbaric Therapy in Autistic Children, Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder currently affecting as many as 1 out of 166 children in the United States. Autism is considered by many to be a permanent, static condition with little hope for improvement. Treatment for autism is centered on special schooling and behavioral therapy; medical science currently has little to offer. Recent research has discovered that some autistic individuals have decreased cerebral perfusion, evidence of gastrointestinal and neuro-inflammation, increased markers of oxidative stress, and a relative mitochondrial dysfunction. Multiple independent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) research studies have revealed hypoperfusion to several areas of the autistic brain, most notably the temporal regions and areas specifically related to language comprehension and auditory processing. Several studies show that diminished blood flow to these areas correlates with many of the clinical features associated with autism including repetitive, self-stimulatory and stereotypical behaviors, and impairments in communication, sensory perception, and social interaction. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been used with clinical success in several cerebral hypoperfusion syndromes including cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome, closed head injury, and stroke. HBOT can compensate for decreased blood flow by increasing the oxygen content of plasma and body tissues and can even normalize oxygen levels in ischemic tissue. In addition, animal studies have shown that HBOT has potent anti-inflammatory effects and reduces oxidative stress. Furthermore, recent evidence demonstrates that HBOT increases the production of mitochondria and mobilizes stem cells from human bone marrow, which may aid recovery in neurodegenerative diseases. Based upon these findings, it is hypothesized that HBOT will improve symptoms in autistic individuals.||Our recent retrospective case series demonstrated that HBOT may improve symptoms in autistic children. We recently completed a prospective pilot trial using HBOT in 18 children which demonstrated statistically significant clinical improvements in autistic children on several standardized scales. Most of the scales were parent-rated, although some were rated by teachers. However, parents were not blinded to the fact that their children received HBOT and evaluation of the children was through parent-rated scales, either of which could lead to bias. There was no placebo or control group. Therefore, the improvements found in this prospective study could have been due merely to chance or the natural development of the children. To determine if HBOT improves symptoms in autistic children, a double-blind controlled study is indicated., 0",1

"Prebiotic Intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorders, Children with ASD have a higher incidence of dietary and/or bowel problems than typically developing children. it has been postulated that imbalances in the gut bacteria and/or metabolites present in the gut may be a contributing factor to these symptoms, with potentially bad (toxin-producing) bacteria colonising the gut. Certain carbohydrates (so-called 'prebiotics') are not digested by the human gut and they provide food for beneficial bacteria and thus they improve the composition by preventing the growth of bad bacteria. Individuals could therefore benefit from these safe and effective dietary interventions to maintain the healthy gut bacteria and overall health. This study is being carried out to establish the effect of one such prebiotic, called galactooligosaccharide (B-GOS) on the relative balance of gut bacteria and metabolites in children with ASD. The aim is to enrol 42 children, ages 5-10 with formal ASD diagnosis and with signed informed consent from their parents, into double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel study. The trial will last 10 weeks in total (2 weeks run in period, 6 weeks treatment and 2 weeks follow up).

"Treatment of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders and Epileptiform EEG With Divalproex Sodium, Epilepsy and epileptiform EEG abnormalities are common co-morbidities in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) that can be considered important biomarkers of cortical dysfunction in these disorders. They may represent a measure of the excitatory-inhibitory imbalance posited to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Treatment of epilepsy is always indicated, but treatment of isolated epileptiform EEG (i.e. in the absence of clinical seizures) is frankly controversial. Since data suggest that these epileptiform discharges are associated with deficits in attention, language and behavior, the investigators believe that they may represent an important and novel treatment target in this population. The proposed study brings together a group of investigators long interested in this problem in order to investigate the efficacy of using an anticonvulsant medication with spike suppression capabilities (VPA in the form of divalproex sodium) to treat children with ASD and isolated epileptiform EEGs. Recruiting from 3 large autism centers (Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) and Vanderbilt University (VU) and University of Louisville (U of L)) with very large pediatric epilepsy units, the investigators propose a 26 week randomized placebo controlled cross over study of VPA in 4-8 year old children with ASD with frequent epileptiform EEG discharges., Abnormal EEGs",1
"Study of Peer Relationships at School, Once families have decided to join the study, and have completed the informed consent process using the ""Social Skills Club - Parent Consent"", and once we obtain letters of agreement from participating elementary schools, children with ASD will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention conditions, SKILLS or ENGAGE, led by two trained doctoral students. Since children will be randomized to either the SKILLS or the ENGAGE group, we are hoping to determine the active ingredients for successfully integrating children with autism. For both the SKILLS and the ENGAGE groups, all interventions and observations of children will take place in the target child's school. Thus, upon admission to the project, research personnel will attend the participant's classroom at school, and distribute consent forms titled ""Peer Relationships at School - Classroom Parent Consent"" to all children in the class. The consenting process should be no more than ten minutes. For those children that return informed consent from their parents, as well as offer assent on the ""Children's Classroom Assent"" to join to the project, social network measures (including brief demographic information), as well as friendship surveys (Friendships Qualities Scale; FQS), and an emotion measure (loneliness questionnaire) will be distributed at pre-intervention (baseline), post-intervention, and follow-up time points. These measures will take approximately 30-40 minutes per each time point. Graduate students will administer the measures and will make every effort to do so at a convenient time for the teacher and for the classroom to avoid utilizing instructional time. In addition, the efficacy of the treatment interventions will be assessed with ongoing direct behavioral observations at entry, twice during treatment, at exit, and at the 2-month follow-up., social networks|friendships|autism spectrum disorder",1
"Comprehensive Collection, Charting, and Communication System, Project Summary: SymTrend is seeking funding to bring low-cost, technology-afforded power and efficiency to the special education (SPED) of a lower functioning child with autism (LFCA). Each LFCA has a federally mandated, individualized education plan (IEP). An effective IEP requires intensive school and home-based behavioral monitoring: iterations of behavioral data recording, progress charting, and team communication. SymTrend will extend the functionality of its current Internet and mobile system for behavioral monitoring to include the use of digital pen technology for recording on specially printed forms. The project will then test the two types of electronic monitoring (iPod Touch and digital pens) against current pencil and paper monitoring. It is hypothesized that an electronic system with four components - i.e., forms creation, data collection, progress charting, and team communication - will reduce the time burden of behavioral monitoring and enable schools to meet the IEP needs of its students within the constraints of very restrictive educational budgets.||Objectives: The three objectives of this project are 1) to design and implement a four-component behavioral monitor for IEPs that is easy-to-use, cost-sensitive, and has the power and efficiency to optimize and sustain behavioral improvement in LFCA; 2) to incorporate functionality for an extensive range of a) learning contexts, b) types of behavioral measurement, and c) progress charting formats that meet IEP reporting requirements; and 3) to contrast electronic behavioral monitoring with standard paper methods in terms of: a) efficiency, b) power, and c) acceptance.||Design and Methods: The test of the system will include a sample 15 children participating in one of two public school systems. LFCA will be monitored by parents and more than one type of professional both at school and at home. Monitoring will occur in the context of skill learning and disruptive behavior elimination. Professionals will keep track of their time and effort doing behavioral recording, charting, and communicating with other members of the IEP team. The research design includes within-subject comparisons of baseline paper monitoring versus electronic monitoring in terms of efficiency, power, and acceptance.||Significance: The electronic behavioral monitoring system created to support IEP use with LFCA can also be used with higher functioning children with autism (HFCA), other developmental disabilities (e.||g., ADHD), other clinical uses (e.g., depression and anxiety), academic use (e.g., university level behavioral science) and commercial use (e.g., human factors studies)., Autism|Behavioral Observations|Electronic diaries|Professionals treating children 3-10 with lower functioning autism",1
"An fMRI Study of the Effect of Intravenous Oxytocin vs. Placebo on Response Inhibition and Face Processing in Autism, Autism is a developmental disorder affecting approximately 60/10,000 individuals. It is characterized by social and language deficits and repetitive behaviors/restricted interests. Functional imaging is becoming a very useful tool in trying to understand the neurobiology of autism. Oxytocin is a hormone produced by the brain to assist with labor and lactation. Recent evidence suggests that it may be involved in social attachment and in repetitive behaviors. In this project, we will study how oxytocin changes the way the brain of autistic adults processes faces, and deals with response inhibition (the ability to interrupt ongoing responses should they prove ineffective or interfering with attaining a goal). There is currently no functional imaging data assessing the effect of oxytocin on the brain. We will explore the activation patterns in response to oxytocin across circuits involved in social cognition (face fusiform area) and response inhibition (caudate, orbitofrontal and dorsolateral cortex) by administering a specific fMRI task activating those circuits before and during an oxytocin infusion. We will also explore the effect of oxytocin in these areas by administering specific cognitive testing not associated with fMRI before and during oxytocin infusion., 0",1

"Open Label of Clinical Trial of Sulforaphane in Children With Autism, Sulforaphane (SF) is an isothiocyanate found in high levels in crucifers belonging to the family Brassicaceae (including broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, Chinese cabbage and turnips). Many previous studies have documented that consumption of these vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of cancer (lung, breast, colon, rectum, and prostate).(Juge et al. 2007) The mechanism of action of these beneficial effects is believed to be due to the ability of SF to up-regulate genes that improve cellular response to oxidative stress, inflammation, DNA-damaging electrophiles, and radiation.(Singh et al. 2014) In a recent small, randomized controlled trial in children with autism, SF was shown to have beneficial effects on aberrant and social behavior.(Singh et al. 2014) The mechanism of action of this beneficial effect has not been established in children with ASD. Our primary goal is to examine changes in urinary metabolites in children with autism who receive SF to determine if changes in behavior are associated with changes in urinary metabolites., 0",1
"Sensory Integration Therapy in Autism: Mechanisms and Effectiveness, Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are among the most common neurodevelopmental disorder with estimated costs of treatment across the lifespan of $3.2 million. A common feature of ASD is over or under sensitivity to the environment and difficulty putting sensory information together in an orderly way, referred to here as sensory issues. Such sensory issues are now included in the diagnostic criteria in the DSM5 under the Restrictive and Repetitive Behaviors and Interests Criteria. These sensory issues have a deleterious effect on functional skills and limit participation in work, education, and social activities for individuals with ASD and their family. Building on previous work, this study seeks to extend understanding of Sensory Integration Therapy (SIT) as a non-invasive intervention to improve functional skills in children with ASD and sensory issues, and to test its efficacy in comparison to commonly used applied behavioral treatments. Further, the investigators will explore the proposed neurobiological mechanisms by which this intervention may work, and phenotypic moderators of outcome. This study utilizes a randomized trial to compare SIT to a commonly used behavioral intervention to evaluate outcomes on functional skills as a basis for improved independence over the lifetime.

"Valproate Response in Aggressive Autistic Adolescents, Autism is a complex biological disorder that generally lasts throughout a person's life.

"The Virtual Mindfulness Study, It is well recognized that autistic individuals experience high rates of mental health issues, but that needed mental health services are often inaccessible. There is some evidence to suggest that mindfulness-based therapies may help to reduce some of these challenges for autistic adults. While in person interventions may be helpful, there are also benefits to participating in virtually based interventions, particularly during the pandemic. Virtual groups have the added benefit of not requiring travel for people who have difficulties with travel because of anxiety or financial constraints. For some autistic individuals, virtual engagement can be preferred over in person interactions because of the flexibility that virtual interactions allow (camera on or off, communicating with text or speaking, being able to attend from home in a familiar and comfortable space).||In a prior CAMH led study, the investigators demonstrated that autism-informed adaptations to a standard mindfulness-based virtually delivered group intervention led to self-reported improvements in mindfulness, self-compassion, and distress, with changes maintained at three months follow-up. This prior study lacked a control group, however so it is not known whether the positive impacts reported were specific to the mindfulness-based intervention itself or to other factors. Building on this previous work, there is a need to study whether improvements are also evident when compared to individuals who do not take part in the intervention.||The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a virtual group mindfulness intervention for autistic adults on their mental health and well-being, compared to a group who has not received the virtual group intervention. Specifically, the investigators will compare change across multiple indicators of mental health and well-being for participants, post-intervention, and at 15 weeks follow-up, to participants in a waitlist control group who have not yet received the intervention.||Study Design: Randomized controlled trial with waitlist control.||Hypotheses We expect that participants in the mindfulness-based intervention group will report improvements in self-reported distress (primary outcome), mindfulness, self-compassion, and sense of autistic belonging (secondary outcomes), relative to the waitlist control group, which will be maintained at 15 weeks follow-up.||Survey Evaluation: All participants will provide pre, post and follow-up survey data related to either a 6-week virtual mindfulness course or waitlist.
